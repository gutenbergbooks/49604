    This book was written in a period when many words had not become

    been left unchanged unless indicated with a Transcriber’s
    Note.</p>

    Footnotes are identified in the text with a superscript number and
    have been accumulated in a table at the end of the text.</p>
  <p class="v1 hang2">
    Transcriber’s Notes are used when making corrections to the text
    or to provide additional information for the modern reader. These

    SAINT RUMOLD, B.&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    PATRON OF MECHLIN.<a
      href="#fn_1"
      class="anchor">1</a></p>
  <p class="intro">
    From the Bollandists. Ward, Act. &amp;c. S.&nbsp;Rumoldi, Lov.
    1662, 4to. Sellerii Act. S.&nbsp;Rumoldi,
    An.&nbsp;1718,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 775.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Rumold renounced the world in his youth and embraced a
    state of voluntary poverty, being convinced that whatever exceeds
    the calls of nature is a useless load and a perfect burden to him
    that bears it. He was the most declared enemy to voluptuousness;
    and by frugality, moderation, and a heart pure and disengaged
    from all seducing vanities, and desires of what is superfluous,
    he tasted the most solid pleasure which virtue gives in freeing
    a man from the tyranny of his passions, when he feels them
    subjected to him, and finds himself above them. Victorious over
    himself, by humility, meekness, and mortification, he reaped in
    his soul, without any obstacles from self-love or inordinate
    attachments, the sweet and happy fruits of assiduous prayer and
    contemplation, whereby he sanctified his studies, in which he
    made great progress, and at the same time advanced daily in
    Christian perfection. He had faithfully served God many years in
    his own country, when an ardent zeal for the divine honor and the
    salvation of souls induced him to travel into Lower Germany to
    preach the faith to the idolaters. He made a journey first to
    Rome to receive his mission from the chief pastor, and with the
    apostolic blessing went into Brabant, great part of which country
    about Mechlin he converted to the faith. He was ordained a
    regionary or missionary bishop without any fixed see. He
    frequently interrupted his exterior functions to renew his spirit
    before God in holy solitude. In his retirement he was slain on
    the 24th of June in&nbsp;775, by two sons of Belial, one of whom
    he had reproved for adultery. His body was thrown into a river,
    but being miraculously discovered, it was honorably interred by
    his virtuous friend and protector, count Ado. A&nbsp;great and
    sumptuous church was built at Mechlin to receive his precious
    relics, which is still possessed of that treasure, and bears the
    name of this saint. The city of Mechlin keeps his feast a solemn
    holiday, and honors him as its patron and apostle. Janning the
    Bollandist gives a long history of his miracles. His great
    church at Mechlin was raised to the metropolitical dignity by
    Paul&nbsp;IV. Ware says that the feast of St.&nbsp;Rumold was
    celebrated as a double festival with an office of nine lessons
    throughout the province of Dublin before the reformation. It was
    extended to the whole kingdom of Ireland in the
    year&nbsp;1741.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    It was from the spirit of prayer that the saints derived all
    their lights and all their strength. This was the source of all
    the blessings which heaven through their intercession showered
    down on the world, and the means which they employed to
    communicate an angelical purity to their souls.<a id="c1_1a">
    </a>“This spirit,” says a father of the Church,<a
      href="#fn_2"
      class="anchor">2</a>
    “is nourished by retreat, which in some manner may be called the
    parent of purity.” This admirable transformation of our souls
    produced by prayer is to be attributed to God’s glory, which by
    prayer he makes to shine in the secret of our hearts. In fine, when
    all the avenues of our senses are
    closed against the creature, and that God dwells with us, and we
    with God; when freed from the tumult and distractions of the
    world we apply all our attention to interior things and consider
    ourselves such as we are, we then become capable of clearly
    contemplating the kingdom of God, established in us by that
    charity and ardent love which consumes all the rust of earthly
    affections. For the kingdom of heaven, or rather the Lord of
    heaven itself, is within us, as Jesus Christ himself assures
    us.</p>

    SS.&nbsp;JULIUS AND AARON,&nbsp;MM.</h3>
  <p>
    These saints were Britons, and seem to have taken, the one a
    Roman and the other a Hebrew name at their baptism. They
    glorified God by martyrdom at Caerleon upon Usk in Monmouthshire,
    in the persecution of Dioclesian, probably about the year
    303.<a id="c1_2a"> </a>St Gildas,<a

    St.&nbsp;Bede,<a

      class="anchor">4</a>
    and others, speak of their triumph as having been most
    illustrious. Leland and Bale say, SS. Julius and Aaron had
    travelled to Rome, and “there applied themselves to the sacred
    studies.” Bede adds, “very many others of both sexes, by
    unheard-of tortures, attained to the crown of heavenly glory.”<a
    id="c1_2b"> </a>Giraldus Cambrensis informs us, that their
    bodies were honored at Caerleon in the year 1200, when he wrote.
    Each of these martyrs had a titular church in that city; that of
    St.&nbsp;Julius, belonged to a nunnery, and that of
    St.&nbsp;Aaron to a monastery of canons. See Godwin De Episc.

<div class="segment">
  <h3 class="sthd" id="c1_3">
    ST.&nbsp;THEOBALD OR THIBAULT,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was of the family of the counts palatine of Champagne, and son
    of count Arnoul. He was born at Provins in Brie in 1017, and was
    called Theobald from the most virtuous archbishop of Vienne, who
    was his uncle. In his youth he preserved his heart free from the
    corruption of the world amidst its vanities; and the more pains
    others took to make him conceive a relish for them, the more
    diligent he was in fencing his heart against their dangers, the
    more perfectly he discovered their emptiness and secret poison.
    In reading the lives of the fathers of the desert he was much
    affected by the admirable examples of penance, self-denial, holy
    contemplation, and Christian perfection, which were set before
    his eyes as it were in a glass, and he earnestly desired to
    imitate them. The lives of St.&nbsp;John the Baptist, of
    St.&nbsp;Paul the hermit, St.&nbsp;Antony, and St.&nbsp;Arsenius
    in their wildernesses, charmed him, and he sighed after the like
    sweet retirement, in which he might without interruption converse
    with God by prayer and contemplation. He often resorted to an
    holy hermit named Burchard, who lived in a little island in the
    Seine; and by making essays he began to inure himself to fasting,
    watching, long prayers, and every rigorous practice of penance.
    He declined all the advantageous matches and places at court or
    in the army which his father could propose to him.<a id="c1_3a">
    </a>His cousin Eudo, count palatine of Champagne, and count of
    Chartres and Blois, upon the death of his uncle Rodolph, the last
    king of Burgundy, in 1034, laid claim to that crown as next heir
    in blood; but the emperor Conrad the Salic seized upon it by
    virtue of the testament of the late king.<a
      href="#fn_5"
      class="anchor">5</a>
    Hereupon ensued a war, and count Arnoul ordered his son to lead
    a body of troops to the succor of his cousin. But the young
    general represented so respectfully to his father the obligation
    of a vow by which he had bound himself to quit the world, that he
    at length extorted his consent.</p>
  <p>
    Soon after the saint and another young nobleman called Walter,
    his intimate friend, each taking one servant, went to the abbey
    of St.&nbsp;Remigius in Rheims, and thence having sent back their
    servants with their baggage, they set out privately; and in the
    clothes of two beggars, in exchange for which they had given
    their own rich garments, they travelled barefoot into Germany.
    Finding the forest of Petingen in Suabia a convenient solitude
    for their purpose, they built themselves there two little cells.
    Having learned from Burchard that manual labor is a necessary
    duty of an ascetic or penitential life, and not being skilled in
    the manner of working to make mats or baskets, they often went
    into the neighboring villages and there hired themselves by the
    day to serve the masons, or to work in the fields, to carry
    stones and mortar, to load and unload carriages, to cleanse the
    stables under the servants of the farmers, or to blow the bellows
    and to make fires for the forges. With their wages they bought
    coarse brown bread, which was their whole subsistence. Whilst
    they worked with their hands, their hearts were secretly employed
    in prayer; and at night retiring again into their forest, they
    watched long, singing together the divine praises, and continuing
    in holy contemplation. Their carriage and the tenderness of their
    complexion discovered that they had not been trained up in manual
    labor, and the reputation of their sanctity after some time drew
    the eyes of men upon them. To shun which they resolved to forsake
    a place where they were no longer able to live in humiliation and
    obscurity. They performed barefoot a pilgrimage to Compostella,
    and returned into Germany.</p>
  <p>
    Passing through Triers, it happened that Theobald there met his
    father count Arnoul; but with his tanned face, and in his ragged
    clothes, passing for a beggar, he was not known by him. He was
    strongly affected, and was scarcely able to stifle the tender
    sentiments with which his heart was quite overcome at the sight
    of so dear and affectionate a parent. However, he suppressed
    them; but to quit the neighborhood where he might be again
    exposed to the like trial, he undertook a pilgrimage to Rome. The
    two fervent penitents travelled everywhere barefoot; and after
    they had visited all the holy places in Italy, they chose for
    their retirement a hideous woody place called Salanigo, near
    Vicenza, where with the leave of the lord of the manor they built
    themselves two cells, near an old ruinous chapel. Prayer and the
    exercises of penance were their constant employment, till after
    two years God called Walter to himself. Theobald looked upon this
    loss as a warning that he had not long to live, and he exerted
    his whole strength, redoubling his pace to run with greater vigor
    as he drew near the end of his race. He had lived on oat bread
    and water, with roots and herbs, but at length he interdicted
    himself even the use of bread, taking no other food but herbs and
    roots. He always wore a rough hair shirt; his bed was a board,
    and for the five last years of his life he took his rest sitting
    on a wooden seat. The bishop of Vicenza promoted him to priest’s
    orders, and several persons put themselves under his direction.
    His lineage and quality being discovered, his aged parents were
    no sooner informed that their son was alive, and that the hermit
    of Salanigo, the reputation of whose sanctity, prophecies, and
    miracles filled all Europe, was that very son whose absence had
    been to them the cause of so long a mourning; but they set out
    with great joy to see him. His frightful desert, his poor cell,
    his tattered clothes, and above all his emaciated body, made so
    strong impressions upon their hearts at the first sight that they
    both cast themselves at his feet, and for a considerable time
    were only able to speak to him by their tears. When they were
    raised from the ground, and had recovered from their first
    surprise, faith overcame in them the sentiments of nature, and
    converted their sorrow into joy. The sight of so moving an
    example extinguished in their hearts all love of the world, and
    they both resolved upon the spot to dedicate themselves to the
    divine service. The count was obliged by his affairs to return
    into Brie, but Gisla, the saint’s mother, obtained her husband’s
    consent to finish her course near the cell of her son. The saint
    made her a little hut at some distance from his own, and took
    great pains to instruct her in the practice of true perfection.
    He was shortly after visited with his last sickness; his body was
    covered over with blotches and ulcers, and every limb afflicted
    with some painful disorder. The servant of God suffered this
    distemper with a most edifying patience and joy. A&nbsp;little
    before his death he sent for Peter the abbot of Vangadice, of the
    order of Camaldoli, from whose hands he had received the religious
    habit a year before. To him he recommended his mother and his
    disciples: and having received the viaticum he expired in peace
    on the last day of June, 1066, being about thirty-three years
    old, of which he had spent twelve at Salanigo and three in
    Suabia, and in his pilgrimages. His relics were translated to the
    church dependent on the abbey of St.&nbsp;Columba, at Sens, and
    afterward to a chapel near Auxerre called St.&nbsp;Thibaud aux
    Bois. He was canonized by Alexander&nbsp;III. and his name is in
    great veneration at Sens, Provins, Paris, Auxerre, Langres, Toul,
    Triers, Autun, and Beauvais. See his life faithfully written by a

    SAINT GAL, CALLED THE FIRST.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    BISHOP OF CLERMONT, IN AUVERGNE.</p>
  <p>
    He was born about the year 489. His father George was of the
    first houses of that province, and his mother Leocadia was
    descended from the family of Vettius Apagatus, the celebrated
    Roman, who suffered at Lyons for the faith of Christ. They both
    took special care of the education of their son; and when he
    arrived at a proper age, proposed to have him married to the
    daughter of a respectable senator. The saint, who had taken a
    resolution to consecrate himself to God, withdrew privately from
    his father’s house to the monastery of Cournon, near the city of
    Auvergne, and earnestly prayed to be admitted there amongst the
    monks; and having soon after obtained the consent of his parents,
    he with joy renounced all worldly vanities to embrace religious
    poverty. Here his eminent virtues distinguished him in a
    particular manner, and recommended him to Quintianus, bishop of
    Auvergne, who promoted him to holy orders.</p>
  <p>
    The bishop dying in 527, St.&nbsp;Gal was appointed to succeed
    him; and in this new character his humility, charity, and zeal
    were conspicuous; but, above all, his patience in bearing
    injuries. Being once struck on the head by a brutal man, he
    discovered not the least emotion of anger or resentment, and by
    this meekness disarmed the savage of his rage. At another time
    Evodius, who from a senator became a priest, having so far forgot
    himself as to treat him in the most insulting manner, the saint,
    without making the least reply, arose meekly from his seat and
    went to visit the churches of the city. Evodius was so touched by
    this conduct, that he cast himself at the saint’s feet in the
    middle of the street and asked his pardon. From this time they
    both lived on terms of the most cordial friendship. St.&nbsp;Gal
    was favored with the gift of miracles; and died about the
    year&nbsp;553. He is mentioned this day in the Roman Martyrology.

    ST.&nbsp;CALAIS, IN LATIN CARILEPHUS.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FIRST ABBOT OF ANILLE IN MAINE.</p>
  <p>
    He was born in Auvergne, of a family equally virtuous and noble.
    He was yet a child when they sent him to the monastery of Menat in
    the diocess of Clermont, in order to be early principled in
    knowledge and piety. Here he became a religious, and practised all
    the prescriptions of the rule with the greatest fervor. After some
    time he quitted the monastery with St.&nbsp;Avi, and they both
    retired to the abbey of Micy near Orleans. The bishop of this city
    having destined them for holy orders, they withdrew themselves
    from the abbey, and advancing together as far as Perche, led by
    their fervor to the austerities of an eremitical life, they
    separated. St.&nbsp;Calais was followed by two persons, who by no
    means would consent to quit him, and with these he went to Maine,
    where he perfectly revived the rigorous discipline of the ancient
    eastern hermits. But as he was constantly visited by numbers who
    sought to live under his direction, he at length consented to
    receive them.<a id="c1_6a"> </a>King Childebert gave him land
    whereon to build a monastery, which was first called Anisole or
    Anille, from the river on which it was situated,<a
      href="#fn_6"
      class="anchor">6</a>
    but it is now, as well as the little town built round it, called
    after the saint. The life of the holy founder was not only
    extraordinary for penance and prayer, but he excelled in the
    exact observance of his rules; insomuch that he constantly
    refused the visit of queen Ultrogotha wife of Childebert, because
    one of the statutes forbade to enter the monastery. He died in
    542, and his name is mentioned this day in the Roman Martyrology.
    A&nbsp;portion of his relics is kept in the abbey of
    St.&nbsp;Calais, but the greatest part is in the chapel of the
    castle of Blois, which also bears his name. See the life of
    St.&nbsp;Calais, written by Siviard, fifth abbot of Anille, with

    SAINT LEONORUS, IN FRENCH LUNAIRE,&nbsp;B.</h3>
  <p>
    He was of a noble family in Wales, and educated under the care of
    St.&nbsp;Iltut; and passing over into that part of France called
    the province of Domnone, he founded a monastery between the
    rivers of Rancé and Arguenon, on a piece of ground which was
    given him by Jona, the lord of the country. His many
    extraordinary virtues drew the attention of king Childebert, who
    very pressingly invited him to Paris, where he was received by
    this prince and his royal consort Ultrogotha with every possible
    demonstration of the highest respect. At his return he had the
    affliction to hear that his protector Jona was stripped of his
    possessions, and murdered by Conomor. Happily however he arrived
    time enough to shelter that unfortunate nobleman’s son Judual
    from the bloody tyrant’s cruelty, and conveyed him safely to
    England: whence Judual afterward returned, and recovered his
    inheritance. The saint is styled bishop, though he had no fixed
    see. For it was then an established custom in Brittany to honor
    the principal abbots with the episcopal dignity. The year in
    which St.&nbsp;Leonorus died is not known. His body was
    translated to a parochial church near St.&nbsp;Malo, which still
    retains the name of St.&nbsp;Lunaire: here his tomb is shown,
    which is empty, his relics being inclosed in a shrine. The feast
    of his translation is on the 13th of October, but he is
    principally honored in the several diocesses of Brittany on the
    1st of July. He is patron of many churches. See the Breviary of

    ST.&nbsp;SIMEON, SURNAMED&nbsp;SALUS.<a
      href="#fn_7"
      class="anchor">7</a></h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Egypt, and born about the year 522. Having
    performed a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, he retired to a desert near
    the Red Sea, where he remained twenty-nine years in the constant
    practice of a most austere penitential life. Here he was
    constantly revolving in mind that we must love humiliations if we
    would be truly humble; that at least we should receive those
    which God sends us with resignation, and own them exceedingly
    less than the measure of our demerits; that it is even sometimes
    our advantage to seek them; that human prudence should not always
    be our guide in this regard; and that there are circumstances
    where we ought to follow the impulse of the Holy Spirit, though
    not unless we have an assurance of his inspiration. The servant
    of God, animated by an ardent desire to be contemptible among men,
    quitted the desert, and at Emesus succeeded to his wish; for by
    affecting the manners of those who want sense, he passed for a
    fool. He was then sixty years old, and lived six or seven years
    in that city, when it was destroyed by an earthquake in 588. His
    love for humility was not without reward, God having bestowed on
    him extraordinary graces, and even honored him with the gift of
    miracles. The year of his death is unknown. Although we are not
    obliged in every instance to imitate St.&nbsp;Simeon, and that it
    would be rash even to attempt it without a special call; yet his
    example ought to make us blush, when we consider with what an ill
    will we suffer the least thing that hurts our pride. See Evagrius,
    a contemporary writer, l.&nbsp;4, c.&nbsp;5; the life of the saint

    SAINT THIERRI, ABBOT OF MONT-D’HOR, NEAR&nbsp;RHEIMS.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born in the district of Rheims. His father Marquard was
    abandoned to every infamous disorder. An education formed on the
    best Christian principles in the house of such a person would more
    than probably be blasted by his bad example; but our saint was
    happily removed, and educated in learning and piety, under the
    edifying example of the holy bishop Remigius.</p>
  <p>
    He married in complaisance to his relations; but easily persuaded
    his wife to embrace the virgin state; and becoming himself a monk,
    he was made superior of an abbey founded by St.&nbsp;Remigius on
    Mont-d’Hor, near Rheims. Some time after he received holy orders,
    and became famous by the many extraordinary conversions he wrought
    through the zeal and unction wherewith he exhorted sinners to
    repentance; among these was his own father, who persevered to his
    death under the direction of his son. He succeeded also, in
    conjunction with St.&nbsp;Remigius, in converting an infamous
    house into a nunnery of pious virgins. According to the most
    common opinion he died on the 1st of July, 533. It is said that
    king Thierri assisted at his funeral, and esteemed himself honored
    in being one of his bearers to the grave. His relics, lest they
    should be exposed to the impiety of the Normans, were hidden under

    SAINT CYBAR, A&nbsp;RECLUSE AT&nbsp;ANGOULEME.</h3>
  <p>
    Eparcus, commonly called Cybar, quitted the world in spite of his
    parents, who would hinder him to follow his vocation; and retiring
    to the monastery of Sedaciac in Perigord, he there served God some
    time under abbot Martin, and soon became known and admired for his
    extraordinary virtues and miracles. Wherefore, in dread of the
    seduction of vain-glory, he left his monastery to hide himself in
    absolute solitude. It was near Angouleme, with the bishop of
    Perigueux’s and his abbot’s leave, he shut himself up in a cell.
    But his virtues were too striking for concealment, and the bishop
    of Angouleme obliged him to accept the priesthood. Cybar was
    extremely austere in his food and apparel, especially during Lent.
    Although a recluse, he did not refuse to admit disciples; but he
    would not allow them manual labor, as, after his own example, he
    willed they should be constantly occupied in prayer. When any of
    them would complain for want of necessaries, he would tell them
    with St.&nbsp;Jerom, that “Faith never feared hunger.” Nor was he
    deceived in his trust on Providence, as he always found abundance
    for himself and his disciples in the beneficence of the faithful;
    insomuch that he was even enabled to redeem a great number of
    captives. He died the 1st of July, 581, having lived about forty
    years in his cell. His relics were kept in the abbey church of his
    name until 1568, when they were burnt by the Huguenots. See

    THE VISITATION OF THE BLESSED&nbsp;VIRGIN.</h3>
  <p>
    From the example of Christ, his blessed Mother, and the apostles,
    St.&nbsp;Thomas shows<a
      href="#fn_8"
      class="anchor">8</a>
    that state to be in itself the most perfect which joins together
    the functions of Martha and Mary, or of the active and
    contemplative life. This is endeavored by those persons who so
    employ themselves in the service of their neighbor, as amidst
    their external employs or conversation often to raise their minds
    to God, feeding always on their heavenly invisible food, as the
    angel did in Toby’s company on earth.<a id="c2_1a"> </a>Who also,
    by the practice and love of daily recollection and much solitude,
    fit themselves to appear in public; and who by having learned the
    necessary art of silence in its proper season, and by loving to
    speak little among men,<a
      href="#fn_9"
      class="anchor">9</a>
    study to be in the first place their own friends,<a id="c2_1b">
    </a>and by reflection and serious consideration to be thoroughly
    acquainted with themselves, and to converse often in heaven.<a
      href="#fn_10"
      class="anchor">10</a>
    Such will be able to acquit themselves of external employs without
    prejudice to their own virtue, when called to them by duty,
    justice, or charity. They may avoid the snares of the world, and
    sanctify their conversation with men. Of this the Blessed Virgin
    is to us a perfect model in the visit paid to her cousin
    Elizabeth, as St.&nbsp;Francis of Sales takes notice, who borrowed
    from this mystery the name which he gave to his Order of nuns,
    who, according to the first plan of their institute, were devoted
    to visit and attend on the sick.</p>
  <p>
    The angel Gabriel, in the mystery of the Annunciation, informed
    the mother of God, that her cousin Elizabeth had miraculously
    conceived, and was then in the sixth month of her pregnancy. The
    Blessed Virgin, out of humility, concealed the favor she had
    received and the wonderful dignity to which she was raised by the
    incarnation of the Son of God in her womb; but in the transport of
    her holy joy and gratitude, she would go to congratulate the
    mother of the Baptist; with which resolution the Holy Ghost
    inspired her for his great designs in favor of her Son’s precursor
    not yet born. <i>Mary</i> therefore <i>arose</i>, saith
    St.&nbsp;Luke, <i>and with haste went into the hilly-country into
    a city of Juda; and entering into the house of Zachary saluted
    Elizabeth</i>. She made this visit to a saint, because the company
    of the servants of God is principally to be sought, from whose
    example and very silence the heart will always treasure up
    something, and the understanding receive some new light and
    improvement in charity. As glowing coals increase their flame by
    contact, so is the fire of divine love kindled in a fervent soul
    by the words and example of those who truly love God. In this
    journey what lessons of humility does the holy Virgin give us! She
    had been just saluted mother of God, and exalted above all mere
    creatures, even the highest seraphim of heaven; yet far from being
    elated with the thoughts of her incomprehensible dignity, she
    appears but the more humble by it. She prevents the mother of the
    Baptist in this office of charity; the mother of God pays a visit
    to the mother of her Son’s servant; the Redeemer of the world goes
    to his precursor. What a subject of confusion is this to the pride
    of the children of the world! who, not content with the rules of
    respect which the law of subordination requires, carry their
    vanity to an excess of ceremoniousness contrary even to good
    manners, and to the freedom of conversation, which they make an
    art of constraint and of torture both to themselves and others;
    and in which they seek not any duty of piety or improvement in
    virtue, but loathsome means of foolish flattery, the gratification
    of vanity, or that dissipation of mind which continually
    entertains it with trifles and idleness, and is an enemy to
    serious consideration and virtue.</p>
  <p>
    When the office of charity called upon Mary, she thought of no
    dangers or difficulties in so painful and long a journey of above
    fourscore miles from Nazareth in Galilee to Hebron, a sacerdotal
    city in the mountainous country on the western side of the tribe
    of Juda. The inspired writer takes notice, that she went with
    haste or with speed and diligence, to express her eagerness to
    perform this good office. Charity knows not what sloth is, but
    always acts with fervor. She likewise would hasten her steps out
    of modesty, not choosing to appear abroad, but as compelled by
    necessity or charity; not travelling out of vanity, idleness, or
    curiosity, but careful in her journey to shun the dissipation of
    the world, according to the remarks of St.&nbsp;Ambrose. Whence we
    may also gather with what care she guarded her eyes, and what was
    the entertainment of her pious soul with God upon the road. Being
    arrived at the house of Zachary, she entered it, and saluted
    Elizabeth. What a blessing did the presence of the God-man bring
    to this house, the first which he honored in his humanity with his
    visit! But Mary is the instrument and means by which he imparts to
    it his divine benediction; to show us that she is a channel
    through which he delights to communicate to us his graces, and to
    encourage us to ask them of him through her intercession. At the
    voice of the mother of God, but by the power and grace of her
    Divine Son, in her womb, Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost
    and the infant in her womb was sanctified; and miraculously
    anticipating the use of reason, knew by divine inspiration the
    mystery of the incarnation, and who it was that came to visit
    him.<a id="c2_1c"> </a>From this knowledge he conceived so great,
    so extraordinary a joy as to leap and exult in the womb.<a
      href="#fn_11"
      class="anchor">11</a>
    If Abraham and all the ancient prophets exulted only to foresee
    in spirit that day when it was at the distance of so many ages,
    what wonder the little Baptist felt so great a joy to see it then
    present! How eagerly did he desire to take up his office of
    precursor, and already to announce to men their Redeemer that he
    might be known and adored by all! But how do we think he adored
    and reverenced him present in his mother’s womb? and what were the
    blessings with which he was favored by him? He was cleansed from
    original sin, and filled with sanctifying grace, was made a
    prophet, and adored the Messiah before he was yet born.</p>
  <p>
    At the same time Elizabeth was likewise filled with the Holy
    Ghost; and by his infused light, she understood the great mystery
    of the Incarnation which God had wrought in Mary, whom humility
    prevented from disclosing it even to a saint, and an intimate
    friend. In raptures of astonishment, Elizabeth pronounced her
    blessed above all other women, she being made by God the
    instrument of his blessing to the world, and of removing the
    malediction which through Eve had been entailed on mankind. But
    the fruit of her womb she called blessed in a sense still
    infinitely higher, he being the immense source of all graces, by
    whom only Mary herself was blessed. Elizabeth, then turning her
    eyes upon herself, cried out—<i>Whence is this to me that the
    mother of my Lord should come to me?</i> She herself had conceived
    barren and by a miracle; but Mary, a virgin, and by the Holy
    Ghost; she conceived one greater than the prophets, but Mary the
    eternal Son of God, himself true God. The Baptist, her son, used
    the like exclamation to express his confusion and humility when
    Christ came to be baptized by his hands. In the like words and
    profound sentiments ought we to receive all the visits of God in
    his graces, especially in the holy sacraments. Elizabeth styles
    Mary, Mother of her Lord, that is, mother of God; and she
    foretells that all things would befall her and her Son which had
    been spoken by the prophets.</p>
  <p>
    Mary hearing her own praise, sunk the lower in the abyss of her
    nothingness, and converting all good gifts to the glory of God,
    whose gratuitous mercy had bestowed them, in the transport of her
    humility, and melting in an ecstasy of love and gratitude, burst
    into that admirable canticle called the <i>Magnificat</i>. It is
    the first record in the New Testament, and both in the noble
    sentiments which compose it, and in the majesty of the style,
    surpasses all those of the ancient prophets. It is the most
    perfect model of thanksgiving and praise for the incarnation of
    the Son of God, and the most precious monument of the profound
    humility of Mary. In it she glorifies God with all the powers of
    her soul for his boundless mercies, and gives to him alone all
    the glory. In the spiritual gladness of her heart she adores her
    Saviour, who had cast his merciful eyes upon her lowliness. Though
    all nations will call her blessed, she declares that nothing is
    her due but abjection, and that this mystery is the effect of the
    pure power and mercy of God; and that he who had dethroned
    tyrants, fed the hungry in the wilderness, and wrought so many
    wonders in favor of his people, had now vouchsafed himself to
    visit them, to live among them, to die for them, and to fulfil all
    things which he had promised by his prophets from the beginning.
    Mary stayed with her cousin almost three months; after which she
    returned to Nazareth.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    Whilst with the Church we praise God for the mercies and wonders
    which he wrought in this mystery, we ought to apply ourselves to
    the imitation of the virtues of which Mary sets us a perfect
    example. From her we ought particularly to learn the lessons by
    which we shall sanctify our visits and conversation; actions which
    are to so many Christians the sources of innumerable dangers and
    sins. We must shun not only scurrilous and profane discourse, but
    whatever is idle, light, airy, or unprofitable; whilst we unbend
    our mind, we ought as much as possible to see that conversation
    which is conducive to the improvement of our hearts or
    understandings, and to the advancement of virtue and solid useful
    knowledge. If we suffer our mind to be puffed up with empty wind,
    it will become itself such as is the nourishment upon which it
    feeds. We should shun the vice of talkativeness, did we but
    consult that detestable vanity itself which betrays us into this
    folly. For nothing is more tyrannical or more odious and
    insupportable in company than to usurp a monopoly of the
    discourse. Nothing can more degrade us in the opinion of others
    than for us to justle, as it were, for the word; to vent all we
    have in our hearts, at least a great deal that we ought to conceal
    there; and without understanding ourselves, or taking a review of
    our meaning or words, to pour out embryos of half-formed
    conceptions, and speak of the most noble subjects in an undress of
    thoughts. What proofs of our vanity and folly, what disgraces,

    SS.&nbsp;PROCESSUS AND MARTINIAN, MARTYRS.</h3>
  <p>
    By the preaching and miracles of SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul at Rome,
    many were converted to the faith, and among others several
    servants and courtiers of the emperor Nero, of whom
    St.&nbsp;Paul<a

    In the year 64 that tyrant first drew his sword against the
    Christians, who were in a very short time become very numerous and
    remarkable in Rome. A&nbsp;journey which he made into Greece in
    67, seems to have given a short respite to the Church in Rome. He
    made a tour through the chief cities of that country, attended by
    a great army of singers, pantomimes, and musicians, carrying
    instead of arms, instruments of music, masks, and theatrical
    dresses. He was declared conqueror at all the public diversions
    over Greece, particularly at the Olympian, Isthmian, Pythian, and
    Nemæan games, and gained there one thousand eight hundred various
    sorts of crowns. Yet Greece saw its nobility murdered, the estates
    of its rich men confiscated, and its temples plundered by this
    progress of Nero. He returned to Rome only to make the streets of
    that great city again to stream with blood. The apostles
    SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul, after a long imprisonment, were crowned
    with martyrdom. And soon after them their two faithful disciples
    Processus and Martinian gained the same crown. Their acts tell us
    that they were the keepers of the Mamertine jail during the
    imprisonment of SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul, by whom they were
    converted and baptized. St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great preached his
    thirty-second homily on their festival, in a church in which their
    bodies lay, at which, he says, the sick recovered their health,
    those that were possessed by evil spirits were freed, and those
    who had forsworn themselves were tormented by the devils. Their
    ancient church on the Aurelian road being fallen to decay, pope
    Paschal&nbsp;I. translated their relics to St.&nbsp;Peter’s church
    on the Vatican hill, as Anastasius informs us. Their names occur
    in the ancient Martyrologies. See Tillemont, Hist. Eccl.

    ST.&nbsp;OTHO, BISHOP OF BAMBERG, CONFESSOR.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Swabia, in Germany, and being a clergyman
    eminent for piety and learning, was chosen by the emperor
    Henry&nbsp;IV. to attend his sister Judith in quality of chaplain
    when she was married to Boleslas&nbsp;III. duke of Poland,<a
    id="c2_3a"> </a>that state remaining deprived of the royal
    dignity<a
      href="#fn_14"
      class="anchor">14</a>
    from the year 1079 till it was restored in 1295, in favor of
    Premislas&nbsp;II. After the death of that princess, Otho
    returned, and was made by Henry&nbsp;IV. his chancellor. That
    prince caused the seals and crosses of every deceased bishop and
    great abbot to be delivered to him, and he sold them to whom he
    pleased. This notorious simony and oppression of the Church was
    zealously condemned by the pope, in opposition to whom the emperor
    set up the antipope Guibert. Otho labored to bring his prince to
    sentiments of repentance and submission, and refused to approve
    his schism or other crimes. Notwithstanding which, so great was
    the esteem which the emperor had for his virtue, that, resolving
    to make choice at least of one good bishop, he nominated him
    bishop of Bamberg in 1103. The saint, notwithstanding the schism,
    went to Rome and received his confirmation together with the pall
    from pope Paschal&nbsp;II. He labored to extinguish the schism,
    and to obviate the mischiefs which it produced; and for this
    purpose he displayed his eloquence and abilities in the diet at
    Ratisbon in 1104. Henry&nbsp;V. succeeding his father in 1106,
    continued to foment the schism; yet inherited the esteem of his
    predecessor for our saint, though he always adhered to the holy
    see, and was in the highest credit with all the popes of his time;
    so strongly does virtue command respect even in its adversaries,
    and such is the power of meekness in disarming the fiercest
    tyrants. St.&nbsp;Otho joined always with the functions of his
    charge the exercises of an interior life, in which he was an
    admirable proficient. He made many pious foundations, calling them
    inns which we erect on our road to eternity.</p>
  <p>
    Boleslas&nbsp;IV. duke of Poland, son of that Boleslas who had
    married the sister of Henry&nbsp;IV. having succeeded his elder
    brother Ladislas&nbsp;II. and conquered part of Pomerania,
    entreated St.&nbsp;Otho to undertake a mission among the idolaters
    of that country. The good bishop having settled his own diocess in
    good order, and obtained of pope Honorius&nbsp;II. a commission
    for that purpose, took with him a considerable number of zealous
    priests and catechists, and passed through Poland into Prussia,
    and thence into eastern Pomerania. He was met by
    Uratislas&nbsp;II. duke of Upper Pomerania, who received the
    sacrament of baptism with the greatest part of his people in 1124.
    St.&nbsp;Otho returned to Bamberg for Easter the following year,
    having appointed priests every where to attend the new converts,
    and finish the work he had so happily begun. The towns of Stetin
    and Julin having again relapsed into idolatry, St.&nbsp;Otho, with
    a second blessing of pope Honorius&nbsp;II. returned into
    Pomerania in 1128, brought those cities back to the faith, and
    through innumerable hardships and dangers carried the light of the
    gospel into Noim, and other remote barbarous provinces. He
    returned again to the care of his own flock, amidst which he died
    the death of the saints on the 30th of June, 1139. He was buried
    on the 2d of July, on which day he is commemorated in the Roman
    Martyrology. He was canonized by Clement&nbsp;III. in 1189. The
    rich shrine which contains his sacred remains is preserved in the
    electoral treasury at Hanover. See Thesaurus Reliquiarum Electoris
    Brunswico-Luneburgensis, folio, printed at Hanover in 1713. See

    ST.&nbsp;MONEGONDES, A&nbsp;RECLUSE AT&nbsp;TOURS.</h3>

    She was a native of Chartres, and honorably married. She had two
    daughters, who were the objects of her happiness and most ardent
    desires in this world till God was pleased, in mercy towards her,
    to deprive her of them both by death. Her grief for this loss was
    at first excessive, and by it she began to be sensible that her
    attachment to them had degenerated into immoderate passion; though
    she had not till then perceived the disorder of a fondness which
    had much weakened in her breast the love of God, and the
    disposition of perfect conformity to his holy will above all
    things and in all things. A&nbsp;fear of offending God obliged her
    to overcome this grief, and she confessed the divine mercy in the
    cure of her inordinate affection which stood in need of so severe
    a remedy. However, resolving to bid adieu to this transitory
    treacherous world, she, with her husband’s consent, built herself
    a cell at Chartres, in which she shut herself up, serving God in
    great austerity and assiduous prayer. She had no other furniture
    than a mat strewed on the floor on which she took her short
    repose, and she allowed herself no other sustenance than coarse
    oat bread with water which was brought her by a servant. She
    afterward removed to Tours, where she continued the same manner
    of life in a cell which she built near St.&nbsp;Martin’s. Many
    fervent women joining her, this cell grew into a famous nunnery,
    which has been since changed into a collegiate church of secular
    canons. St.&nbsp;Monegondes lived many years a model of perfect
    sanctity, and died in 570. She is named in the Roman

    ST.&nbsp;PHOCAS, GARDENER,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    From his panegyric, written by St.&nbsp;Asterius, and another by
    St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, t.&nbsp;2, ed. Ben. p.&nbsp;704, Ruinart,
    p.&nbsp;627.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 303.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Phocas dwelt near the gate of Sinope, a city of Pontus,
    and lived by cultivating a garden, which yielded him a handsome
    subsistence, and wherewith plentifully to relieve the indigent.
    In his humble profession he imitated the virtue of the most holy
    anchorets, and seemed in part restored to the happy condition of
    our first parents in Eden. To prune the garden without labor and
    toil was their sweet employment and pleasure. Since their sin,
    the earth yields not its fruit but by the sweat of our brow. But
    still, no labor is more useful or necessary, or more natural to
    man, and better adapted to maintain in him vigor of mind or health
    of body than that of tillage; nor does any part of the universe
    rival the innocent charms which a garden presents to all our
    senses, by the fragrancy of its flowers, by the riches of its
    produce, and the sweetness and variety of its fruits; by the
    melodious concert of its musicians, by the worlds of wonders which
    every stem, leaf, and fibre exhibit to the contemplation of the
    inquisitive philosopher, and by that beauty and variegated lustre
    of colors which clothe the numberless tribes of its smallest
    inhabitants, and adorn its shining landscapes, vying with the
    brightest splendor of the heavens, and in a single lily surpassing
    the dazzling lustre with which Solomon was surrounded on his
    throne in the midst of all his glory. And what a field for
    contemplation does a garden offer to our view in every part,
    raising our souls to God in raptures of love and praise,
    stimulating us to fervor, by the fruitfulness with which it repays
    our labor, and multiplies the seed it receives; and exciting us
    to tears of compunction from our insensibility to God by the
    barrenness with which it is changed into a frightful desert,
    unless subdued by assiduous toil! Our saint joining prayer with
    his labor, found in his garden itself an instructive book, and an
    inexhausted fund of holy meditation. His house was opened to all
    strangers and travellers who had no lodging in the place; and
    after having for many years most liberally bestowed the fruit of
    his labor on the poor, he was found worthy also to give his life
    for Christ. Though his profession was obscure, he was well known
    over the whole country by the reputation of his charity and
    virtue.</p>
  <p>
    When a cruel persecution, probably that of Dioclesian in 303, was
    suddenly raised in the Church, Phocas was immediately impeached as
    a Christian, and such was the notoriety of his pretended crime,
    that the formality of a trial was superseded by the persecutors,
    and executioners were despatched with an order to kill him on the
    spot wherever they should find him. Arriving near Sinope, they
    would not enter the town, but stopping at his house without
    knowing it, at his kind invitation they took up their lodging with
    him. Being charmed with his courteous entertainment, they at
    supper disclosed to him the errand upon which they were sent, and
    desired him to inform them where this Phocas could be most easily
    met with. The servant of God, without the least surprise, told
    them he was well acquainted with the man, and would give them
    certain intelligence of him next morning. After they were retired
    to bed he dug a grave, prepared everything for his burial, and
    spent the night in disposing his soul for his last hour. When it
    was day he went to his guests, and told them Phocas was found, and
    in their power whenever they pleased to apprehend him. Glad at
    this news, they inquired where he was. “He is here present,” said
    the martyr,—“I&nbsp;myself am the man.” Struck at his undaunted
    resolution, and at the composure of his mind, they stood a
    considerable time as if they had been motionless, nor could they
    at first think of imbruing their hands in the blood of a person in
    whom they discovered so heroic a virtue, and by whom they had been
    so courteously entertained. He indirectly encouraged them saying,
    that as for himself, he looked upon such a death as the greatest
    of favors, and his highest advantage. At length, recovering
    themselves from their surprise, they struck off his head. The
    Christians of that city, after peace was restored to the Church,
    built a stately church which bore his name, and was famous over
    all the East. In it were deposited the sacred relics, though some
    portions of them were dispersed in other churches.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Asterius, bishop of Amasea about the year 400, pronounced
    the panegyric of this martyr, on his festival, in a church,
    probably near Amasea, which possessed a small part of his
    remains.<a id="c3_1a"> </a>In this discourse<a
      href="#fn_18"
      class="anchor">18</a>
    he says, “that Phocas from the time of his death was become a
    pillar and support of the churches on earth: he draws all men to
    his house; the highways are filled with persons resorting from
    every country to this place of prayer. The magnificent church
    which (at Sinope) is possessed of his body, is the comfort and
    ease of the afflicted, the health of the sick, the magazine
    plentifully supplying the wants of the poor. If in any other
    place, as in this, some small portion of his relics be found, it
    also becomes admirable, and most desired by all Christians.” He
    adds, that the head of St.&nbsp;Phocas was kept in his beautiful
    church in Rome, and says, “The Romans honor him by the concourse
    of the whole people in the same manner they do Peter and Paul.” He
    bears testimony that the sailors in the Euxine, Ægean, and
    Adriatic seas, and in the ocean, sing hymns in his honor, and that
    the martyr has often succored and preserved them; and that the
    portion of gain which they in every voyage set apart for the poor
    is called Phocas’s part. He mentions that a certain king of
    barbarians had sent his royal diadem set with jewels, and his rich
    helmet a present to the church of St.&nbsp;Phocas, praying the
    martyr to offer it to the Lord in thanksgiving for the kingdom
    which his divine majesty had bestowed upon him.<a id="c3_1b">
    </a>St.&nbsp;Chrysostom received a portion of the relics of Saint
    Phocas, not at Antioch, as Baronius thought, and as Fronto le Duc
    and Baillet doubt, but at Constantinople as Montfaucon
    demonstrates.<a
      href="#fn_19"
      class="anchor">19</a>
    On that solemn occasion the city kept a great festival two
    days,<a id="c3_1c"> </a>and St.&nbsp;Chrysostom preached two
    sermons, only one of which is extant.<a
      href="#fn_20"
      class="anchor">20</a>
    In this he says, that the emperors left their palaces to reverence
    these relics, and strove to share with the rest in the blessings
    which they procure men. The emperor Phocas built afterward another
    great church at Constantinople in honor of this martyr, and caused
    a considerable part of his relics to be translated thither. The
    Greeks only style Saint Phocas hiero-martyr or sacred martyr,
    which epithet they sometimes give to eminent martyrs who were not
    bishops, as Ruinart demonstrates against Baronius.</p>

    Wales, which he left in his youth, and retired into Armorica to
    live a recluse. He stopt at the isle of Groie, which is about a
    league from the mouth of the Blavet. Grallon was then lord of the
    isle, and was so edified at his conversation, that he bestowed on
    him, for founding a monastery, the land between the confluence of
    the river Isol and Ellé. For which reason even to this day, the
    abbey is called Kemperle, which in the old British language

    blessing, gave him the land near the river Blavet, which was then

  <p>
    He seems to have been born in Poitou, and having dedicated himself
    to the service of the Church, he received the tonsure in the city
    of Tours. St.&nbsp;Germain, bishop of Paris, invited him to his
    diocess, formed him to virtue, and, in token of esteem for his
    merit, made him his archdeacon. After the death of Baldegisil, an
    unworthy prelate, who sought only to enrich himself by the spoils
    of his church, St.&nbsp;Bertran was chosen his successor in the
    diocess of Mans in 586. At first he met some opposition from the
    corrupt manners of his people, but zealous endeavors to restore
    them to virtue had soon the deserved success. By his prudence he
    saved the state from a war which threatened it from Waroc and
    Windimacle, princes of Brittany. He was called to the court of
    Gontran, king of Orleans and Burgundy, to negotiate certain
    interesting matters regarding the Church. He built, endowed, and
    repaired a great number of hospitals and churches. His will, which
    he made in 615, is an esteemed piece of church-antiquity. In it
    are many considerable legacies to churches and monasteries. But
    what is singularly remarkable, we see by it, that the holy bishop
    enjoyed on every occasion the favor and protection of Fredegonda.
    During the troubles occasioned by the civil wars in France,
    St.&nbsp;Bertran was three several times banished from his
    diocess. This introduced many disorders among his people, which he
    happily removed with the assistance of Clotaire, who after long
    struggles at length united to his kingdom those of Burgundy and
    Austrasia. It is believed that he died the 30th of June, 623. But
    he is honored on the 3d of July, being the day on which his relics
    were translated. See St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours, Hist. l.&nbsp;8,

    would probably have the sooner worn out and destroyed:<a
    id="c4_1a"> </a>which cardinal Lugo shows to have often happened
    by several instances in austere religious Orders.<a
      href="#fn_23"
      class="anchor">23</a>
    The recovery of the young count was looked upon as miraculous. As
    he grew up, his sprightly genius, his innocence and sincere piety,
    and the sweetness of his temper and manners charmed the good
    monks; and he had already made a considerable progress in his
    studies when his father removed him to Ausburg, where he placed
    him under the care of Adalberon, bishop of that city. The prelate,
    according to the custom of those times, made him his chamberlain
    when he was only sixteen years old, afterward promoted him to the
    first orders, and instituted him to a canonry in his cathedral.
    The young clergyman was well apprised of the dangers, and
    instructed in the duties of his state, which he set himself with
    all his strength faithfully to discharge. Prayer and study filled
    almost all his time, and the poor had much the greatest share in
    his revenues. During a pilgrimage which he made to Rome, this
    bishop died, and was succeeded by Hiltin. After his return he
    continued his former manner of life, advancing daily in fervor and
    devotion, and in the practices of humility and mortification. He
    was most scrupulously careful to shun as much as possible the very
    shadow of danger, especially with regard to temptations against
    purity, and it was his usual saying to others: “Take away the
    fuel, and you take away the flame.”</p>
  <p>
    Hilton dying in 924, Henry the Fowler, king of Germany, nominated
    our saint, who was then thirty-one years of age, to the bishopric
    of Ausburg, and he was consecrated on Holy Innocents’ day. The
    Hungarians and Sclavonians had lately pillaged that country,
    murdered the holy recluse Saint Guiborate, whom the Germans honor
    as a martyr, plundered the city of Ausburg, and burnt the
    cathedral. The new bishop, not to lose time, built for the present
    a small church, in which he assembled the people, who in their
    universal distress stood in extreme need of instruction, comfort,
    and relief; all which they found so abundantly in Ulric, that
    every one thought all the calamities they had suffered
    sufficiently repaired by the happiness they enjoyed in possessing
    such a pastor. He excused himself from attending the court,
    knowing of what importance the presence of a bishop is to his
    flock, for which he is to give a severe account to God. The
    levying and care of his troops, which in quality of prince of the
    empire he was obliged to send to the army, he entrusted to a
    nephew, devoting himself entirely to his spiritual functions. He
    rose every morning at three o’clock to assist with his canons at
    matins and lauds: after which he recited the psalter, litany, and
    other prayers. At break of day he said in choir the office for the
    dead, and prime, and was present at high mass. After tierce and
    long private devotions he said mass. He only left the church after
    none, and then went to the hospital, where he comforted the sick,
    and every day washed the feet of twelve poor people, giving to
    each of them a liberal alms. The rest of the day he employed in
    instructing, preaching, visiting the sick, and discharging all the
    duties of a vigilant pastor. He took his frugal meal only in the
    evening before complin. In this the poor always shared with him,
    for whom and for strangers meat was served up, except on
    fast-days, though he never touched it himself. He allowed himself
    very little time for sleep, lay on straw, and never used any
    linen. In Lent he redoubled his austerities and devotions. He made
    every year the visit of his whole diocess, and held a synod of his
    clergy twice a year. Upon the death of Henry&nbsp;I. Otho&nbsp;I.
    succeeded in the kingdom of Germany, between whom and his
    unnatural son Luitolf, a civil war broke out. St.&nbsp;Ulric
    strenuously declared himself against the rebels, who on that
    account harassed and plundered his diocess. But Arnold, count
    palatine, being slain before the walls of Ratisbon, St.&nbsp;Ulric
    obtained the king’s pardon for his son and the rest of the
    rebels.</p>
  <p>
    The saint had fenced the city of Ausburg with strong walls, and
    erected several fortresses to secure the people from the inroads
    of barbarians. This was a precaution of the utmost importance; for
    the Hungarians made a second incursion, and laid siege to Ausburg.
    The good pastor continued in prayer, like Moses on the mountain,
    for his people, whom he convened in frequent processions and
    devotions. His prayers were heard, and the barbarians, being
    seized with a sudden panic fear, raised the siege and fled in
    great confusion. They were met and cut to pieces by Otho, who, in
    962, was crowned Emperor by the pope. St.&nbsp;Ulric built his
    cathedral in a stately manner, and dedicated it again to God in
    honor of St.&nbsp;Afra, the celebrated patroness of Ausburg, in
    which city she received the crown of martyrdom in the persecution
    of Dioclesian. She is commemorated on the 5th of August. The saint
    earnestly desired to resign his bishopric, and retired to the
    monastery of St.&nbsp;Gal, some time before his death; but met
    with too great opposition. He made a second journey of devotion to
    Rome, and was received with extraordinary marks of esteem by the
    pope, and at Ravenna by the emperor and his pious empress.
    Otho&nbsp;I. died in May, 973, and from that time the saint’s
    health began sensibly to decline. During his last sickness he
    redoubled his fervor. In his agony he caused himself to be laid on
    ashes blessed and strewed on the floor in the form of a cross, in
    which posture he died amidst the prayers of his clergy, on the 4th
    of July, 973, being about fourscore years old, and having been
    bishop fifty years. He was buried in the church of St.&nbsp;Afra,
    which at present bears his name. His sanctity was attested by
    miracles, and he was canonized by pope John&nbsp;XV. in 993.</p>

    SAINT&nbsp;ODO, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born in the province of East Angles, of noble Danish
    parents, who, about the year 870, had accompanied Inguar and Hubba
    in their barbarous expedition, and had acquired a peaceable
    plentiful settlement in that part of England. Odo from a child
    loved the Christian religion, frequented the churches, and often
    spoke with honor of Christ to his parents; for which he was
    frequently severely chastised by them, and at length disinherited
    and turned out of doors. The young nobleman, rejoicing to see
    himself naked, and found worthy to suffer something for God, chose
    him for his inheritance; and, fearing lest by sloth he should lose
    the advantages he had already gained, resolved to give himself
    wholly to God, and embrace an ecclesiastical state.<a id="c4_2a">
    </a>He was enabled to perform his studies by the liberality of the
    most noble and virtuous duke Athelm, who seems to have been son of
    the ealderman Athelm, who in the reign of king Ethelwolf, being
    assisted by the Dorsetshire men, had defeated the Danes near
    Portland, in 838. The duke or governor Athelm was one of the
    principal noblemen of England in the reign of king Alfred, and in
    the Saxon annals, is styled ealderman of Wiltshire. Being a most
    religious man, he was much taken with the piety of Odo. In 887 he
    made a devout pilgrimage to Rome, and carried thither the alms of
    king Alfred and of the West-Saxons, as the Saxon Annals testify.
    He had before that time procured Odo to be ordained priest, and
    made use of him for his confessarius, as did many others who
    belonged to the court. He recited every day the church office with
    him, as it was then customary for pious persons among the laity to
    do. Our saint accompanied him to Rome in quality of chaplain. On
    the road, this nobleman fell sick of a fever which in seven days
    reduced him almost to extremity. But Odo, after praying for him,
    presented him a glass of wine on which he had made the sign of the
    cross, bidding him have an entire confidence in God. Athelm had no
    sooner drunk the glass, than he found himself perfectly cured, and
    able to get on horseback. Athelm died in 898.</p>
  <p>
    Odo continued to be caressed as much as ever, and was often
    employed by the kings Alfred and his son Edward the Elder, who
    began his reign in 901. King Alfred had by his wisdom and prowess
    raised the English monarchy to the highest pitch of grandeur, and
    the Danes who, from the time of the martyrdom of St.&nbsp;Edmund,
    were possessed of part of Northumberland, and of the kingdom of
    the East-Angles, were confined within those territories, and
    restrained in the eastern provinces from making inroads by the
    famous ditch running from the northern fens to the river Ouse,
    and into Suffolk, separating Mercia and the kingdom of the
    East-Angles, called at this day, from a town of that name,
    Reech-dike, and by the common people Devil’s-dike. This great
    ditch, mentioned by the Saxon Annals in the reign of Edward the
    Elder, seems made about this time. When the Danes broke the truce,
    king Edward entirely subdued them in the country of the
    East-Angles; he also defeated the Scots, Cumbrians, and Welch.<a
    id="c4_2b"> </a>He built towns and fortresses in many parts of the
    kingdom, as Ethelred, earl of Mercia, and after his death his
    courageous and virtuous widow Ethelfleda, daughter to king Alfred,
    did in the middle counties. But nothing reflects greater honor on
    the name of this king, and on his wise counsellors, than the body
    or code of laws which he added to those of his father Alfred,<a
      href="#fn_25"
      class="anchor">25</a>
    in enacting which the Danish king of the East-Angles, Guthrun, or
    rather Guthrun’s successor, Eoric, concurred. In these laws only
    pecuniary fines are prescribed for theft, and most other crimes;
    for which capital punishments were not generally instituted before
    the thirteenth century. Edward the Elder reigned twenty-four
    years, and dying in 925 was buried in the monastery which his
    father Alfred had founded at Winchester.</p>
  <p>
    Athelstan, his eldest son, reigned fourteen years with great
    prudence and valor. His father Edward having extinguished the
    kingdom of the Danes among the East-Angles, Athelstan expelled
    them out of Northumberland; obliged the Welch to pay him a
    considerable annual tribute; and in 938 vanquished also the Scots.
    For their king, Constantine, protecting the Danes in
    Northumberland under their last king Guthfrith and his son Anlaff,
    drew on himself the arms of king Athelstan, who marched with his
    victorious army to the very north of Scotland, in 934, as William
    of Malmesbury relates. In the same year Constantine invaded
    England with a great army of Scots, Danes, and Irish, another
    Anlaff, king of Dublin and some of the Western Islands, coming
    over to his assistance. Athelstan met them at Brunanburgh, a place
    at present unknown, near the Humber, and with his valiant
    West-Saxons attacking Anlaff, whilst his cousin Turketil, at the
    head of the Londoners, fell on the Scots, he gained a most
    complete victory, which he ascribed to the intercession of Saint
    John of Beverly. Having on the other side driven the Welch out of
    Exeter he founded there a noble monastery, which was afterward
    made the cathedral when the bishopric was removed from Crediton to
    that city. Alfred of Beverly calls Athelstan the first monarch of
    all England, though out of modesty he never assumed that title,
    but left it to his brother Edred to take. For after the extinction
    of the Danish kingdom in Northumberland, and the death of
    Ethelfleda, countess of Mercia, there remained no petty sovereign
    in his dominions, which had always been the case from Egbert to
    his time. Athelstan also subdued the Welch and the Scots, and
    according to our historians made not only the former, but likewise
    the latter tributary, though this the Scottish writers deny with
    regard to their country. King Athelstan was a great lover of
    peace, piety, and religion: he was devout, affable to all, learned
    himself, and a patron of learned men; and he was as much admired
    and beloved by his subjects for his humility and humanity as he
    was feared by enemies and rebels for his military skill and
    invincible courage. He framed many good laws, in which he
    inflicted chiefly pecuniary penalties for crimes; for which
    purpose he fixed for every offence a value or price according to
    every one’s rank and estate. This great king reposed an entire
    confidence in the prudence and sanctity of his chaplain, and not
    content to make use of his counsels in his most weighty concerns,
    he carried him with him in his war, that he might always animate
    himself to virtue by his example and holy advice. The kingdom of
    the West-Saxons was for some time all comprised under the diocess
    of Winchester, till in the reign of king Ina, about the year 705,
    the see of Shirburne was erected, and in 905 that of Wilton for
    Wiltshire, though these two sees were again united and fixed at
    Salisbury in 1046. King Athelstan about the beginning of his
    reign procured St.&nbsp;Odo to be chosen second bishop of Wilton,
    according to Le Neve’s Fasti, though some say of Shirburne.
    Nevertheless, the saint was obliged often to attend the king, and
    was present at the great battle of Brunanburgh, against the Danes,
    Scots, and Irish, in which Athelstan, being attacked by Anlaff,
    and almost surrounded by enemies, having also broken or lost his
    sword, called aloud for help. St.&nbsp;Odo ran in upon this
    occasion, and first discovered to the king a sword hanging by his
    side, which was thought to have been sent from heaven, with which,
    animated by the saint, he gained one of the most glorious and
    advantageous victories that ever was won by the English
    nation.</p>
  <p>
    Athelstan dying in 941, left the crown to his brother Edmund, at
    that time only eighteen years of age. This prince reduced a second
    time the Northumbers and Anlaff the Dane, who had again revolted;
    and governed by the wise counsels of St.&nbsp;Odo, he enacted many
    wholesome laws, especially to prevent family feuds and murders.
    By one of these it is ordained that if several thieves combine
    together, the eldest shall be hanged, the rest whipped thrice.
    This seems the first law by which robbery was punished in England
    by death. The king was religious and valiant, and being a judge of
    men, reposed an entire confidence in St.&nbsp;Odo, who, in 942,
    was translated to the metropolitan see of Canterbury. The saint
    had consented to his first promotion with great reluctance. But he
    opposed the second a long time with a dread which saints are
    usually filled with on such occasions. He alleged first, his
    unworthiness, secondly, the canons against translations, and
    thirdly, that he was no monk. His two first difficulties were
    overruled; and as to the third, he at length consented to receive
    the Benedictin habit from the hands of the abbot of Fleuri, now
    St.&nbsp;Bennet’s on the Loire, a house then famous for its
    regularity. The abbot was therefore invited into England for this
    purpose, or according to others, St.&nbsp;Odo travelled to Fleuri,
    and received the habit from his hands; after which he was
    installed archbishop. King Edmund was assassinated by Leof, an
    outlawed thief, who had insolently seated himself at the king’s
    table, in a great banquet which the king gave on the feast of
    St.&nbsp;Austin, archbishop of Canterbury, in 948.</p>
  <p id="c4_2c">
    Edmund left two sons very young, Edwy and Edgar, but was succeeded
    by his brother Edred, in whose days happened the following
    miracle, related by Eadmer in his exact life of our saint; also by
    William of Malmesbury, and the Chronicles of the Church of
    Canterbury, quoted in Parker’s British Antiquities, and Du Pin.<a
      href="#fn_26"
      class="anchor">26</a>
    Some of the clergy at Canterbury being tempted to doubt of the
    real presence of Christ’s body in the holy eucharist, St.&nbsp;Odo
    begged by his prayers that God would be pleased mercifully to
    demonstrate to them the truth of this sacred mystery; and at this
    petition, whilst he was saying mass in his cathedral, at the
    breaking of the host, blood was seen by all the people distilling
    from it into the chalice; the saint called up to the altar those
    who labored under the temptation before-mentioned, and others then
    present, to bear witness to the miracle. Full of gratitude, they
    afterward celebrated with their archbishop a solemn thanksgiving
    for this wonderful miracle, in which Christ had manifested himself
    visible in the flesh to their corporeal eyes. King Edred died in
    955, after a lingering illness, which he sanctified by the most
    edifying patience and acts of devotion, having reigned nine years
    and a half. He took the title of king of Great Britain, as he
    styles himself in a charter which he gave to the abbey of
    Croyland, recited by Ingulphus.<a id="c4_2d"> </a>In another,
    given to the abbey of Reculver,<a
      href="#fn_27"
      class="anchor">27</a>
    he calls himself <i>Monarch of all England</i>.</p>
  <p>
    Edwy, the eldest son of king Edmund, succeeded next to the throne,
    and was crowned at Kingston by St.&nbsp;Odo. But being a youth
    abandoned to excessive lust, after the coronation dinner he left
    his bishops and nobles to go to his mistress Ethelgiva, who was
    his own near relation. St.&nbsp;Dunstan, then abbot of
    Glastenbury, reproved him by order of St.&nbsp;Odo, but was
    banished by the tyrant, and the monks turned out of Glastenbury
    and many other monasteries. St.&nbsp;Odo exerted his zeal against
    the adulteress, but the king repaired to Gloucester when she fled
    to that city. The enormities of his reign stirred up the Mercians
    and Northumbers to take up arms against him, and to crown his
    younger brother Edgar. Edwy retained the kingdom of the
    West-Saxons till his death, which happened in 959, according to
    Florence of Worcester and Laud’s copy of the Saxon annals.</p>
  <p>
    Edgar exceedingly honored St.&nbsp;Odo, recalled St.&nbsp;Dunstan,
    and advanced him to the bishopric of Worcester. He reigned about
    sixteen years in uninterrupted peace and prosperity, till his
    death in 975, beloved by all his subjects, and revered by
    foreigners. William of Malmesbury and Florence of Worcester
    mention his two great fleets, said to have consisted of three
    thousand six hundred ships, with which he yearly scoured the
    British seas; and he had six or eight petty kings often to wait on
    him, namely, Kenneth of the Scots, Malcolm of Cumberland, Maccus,
    lord of Man and the Isles, and five princes of Wales, who all
    rowed his galley from Chester down the river Dee.<a id="c4_2e">
    </a>These princes of Wales were the successors of Howel Dha, the
    wise legislator and powerful prince of all Wales.<a
      href="#fn_28"
      class="anchor">28</a>
    King Edgar’s salutary laws are chiefly to be ascribed to
    St.&nbsp;Odo and St.&nbsp;Dunstan. This great king, by the
    direction of these holy men, set himself earnestly to repair the
    damages which the Church and State had received under the tyranny
    of his brother.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Odo never intermitted the daily instruction of his clergy
    and flock, notwithstanding his great age, and strenuously labored
    to advance daily in the divine love. He died in 961. His relics,
    when his shrine was plundered at the change of religion, seem to
    have been deposited under a small tomb which is seen at this day
    in the same place where the shrine formerly stood. His name was
    famous in our English Martyrologies. For his virtue he was usually
    styled whilst living, <i>Odo se gode</i>, that is, in the Saxon
    language, <i>Odo the Good</i>.<a id="c4_2f"> </a>The Constitutions
    of St.&nbsp;Odo seem charges delivered by him to the clergy.<a
      href="#fn_29"
      class="anchor">29</a>
    The laws of the kings Athelstan, Edmund, and Edgar, are part laws
    of the State, part of the Church. They were enacted in general
    assemblies or synods, and are for the most part to be ascribed to
    St.&nbsp;Odo. See Matthew of Westminster, Florence of Worcester,
    and the life of St.&nbsp;Odo, written, not by Osbern the famous
    monk of Canterbury, in 1070, as Mabillon conjectured, Sæc. Ben.
    &nbsp;V. p.&nbsp;203, but by Eadmer, the disciple of
    St.&nbsp;Anselm, in 1121, as Henry Wharton demonstrates in his
    Preface, vol.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;10, Anglia Sacra. The Life of
    St.&nbsp;Odo, written by Osbern, and quoted by William of
    Malmesbury, seems nowhere to be extant. The History of
    St.&nbsp;Odo is compiled by Ericus Pantopidanus in his Gesta
    Danorum extra Daniam. Hafniæ. 1740. t.&nbsp;2, §&nbsp;2,

    ST.&nbsp;SISOES OR SISOY, ANACHORET&nbsp;IN&nbsp;EGYPT.</h3>
  <p>
    After the death of St.&nbsp;Antony, St.&nbsp;Sisoes was one of the
    most shining lights of the Egyptian deserts.<a id="c4_3a"> </a>He
    was an Egyptian by birth. Having quitted the world from his youth,
    he retired to the desert of Sceté, and lived some time under the
    direction of abbot Hor. The desire of finding a retreat yet more
    unfrequented induced him to cross the Nile and hide himself in the
    mountain where Saint Antony died some time before. The memory of
    that great man’s virtues being still fresh, wonderfully supported
    his fervor. He imagined he saw him, and heard the instructions he
    was wont to deliver to his disciples; and he strained every nerve
    to imitate his most heroic exercises, the austerity of his
    penance, the rigor of his silence, the almost unremitting ardor of
    his prayer, insomuch that the reputation of his sanctity became so
    illustrious as to merit the full confidence of all the neighboring
    solitaries. Some even came a great distance to be guided in the
    interior ways of perfection; and, in spite of the pains he took,
    he was forced to submit his love of silence and retreat to the
    greater duty of charity. He often passed two days without eating,
    and was so rapt in God that he forgot his food, so that it was
    necessary for his disciple Abraham to remind him that it was time
    to break his fast.<a id="c4_3b"> </a>He would sometimes be even
    surprised at the notice, and contend that he had already made his
    meal; so small was the attention he paid to the wants of his
    body.<a
      href="#fn_30"
      class="anchor">30</a>
    His prayer was so fervent that it often passed into ecstasy.<a
    id="c4_3c"> </a>At other times his heart was so inflamed with
    divine love, that, scarce able to support its violence, he only
    obtained relief from his sighs, which frequently escaped without
    his knowledge, and even against his will.<a
      href="#fn_31"
      class="anchor">31</a>

      class="anchor">32</a>
    His ordinary work was making baskets. He was tempted one day as
    he was selling them, to anger; instantly he threw the baskets away
    and ran off. By efforts like these to command his temper he
    acquired a meekness which nothing could disturb.<a id="c4_3e">
    </a>His zeal against vice was without bitterness; and when his
    monks fell into faults, far from affecting astonishment or the
    language of reproach, he helped them to rise again with a
    tenderness truly paternal.<a
      href="#fn_33"
      class="anchor">33</a>
    When he once recommended patience and the exact observance of
    rules, he told the following anecdote: “Twelve monks, benighted on
    the road, observed that their guide was going astray. This, for
    fear of breaking their rule of silence, they forbore to notice,
    thinking within themselves that at daybreak he would see his
    mistake and put them in the right road. Accordingly, the guide
    discovering his error, with much confusion, was making many
    apologies; when the monks being now at liberty to speak, only
    said, with the greatest good humor, ‘Friend, we saw very well
    that you went out of your road; but we were then bound to
    silence.’<a id="c4_3f"> </a>The man was struck with astonishment,
    and very much edified at this answer expressive of such patience
    and strictness of observance.”<a

    Some Arians had the impudence to come to his mount, and utter
    their heresy before his disciples. The saint, instead of an
    answer, desired one of the monks to read St.&nbsp;Athanasius’s
    treatise against Arianism, which at once stopped their mouths and
    confounded them. He then dismissed them with his usual good
    temper. St.&nbsp;Sisoes was singularly devoted to humility; and in
    all his advices and instructions to others, held constantly before
    their eyes this most necessary virtue. A&nbsp;recluse saying to
    him one day, “Father, I&nbsp;always place myself in the presence
    of God;” he replied, “It would be much more your advantage to
    place yourself below every creature, in order to be securely
    humble.”<a id="c4_3g"> </a>Thus, while he never lost sight of the
    divine presence, it was ever accompanied with the consciousness of
    his own nothingness and misery.<a
      href="#fn_35"
      class="anchor">35</a>
    <a id="c4_3h"> </a>“Make yourself little,” said he to a monk,
    “renounce all sensual satisfactions, disengage yourself from the
    empty cares of the world, and you will find true peace of mind.”<a
      href="#fn_36"
      class="anchor">36</a>
    <a id="c4_3i"> </a>To another, who complained that he had not yet
    arrived at the perfection of St.&nbsp;Antony, he said, “Ah! if
    I&nbsp;had but one only of that great man’s feelings, I&nbsp;would
    be all one flame of divine love.”<a
      href="#fn_37"
      class="anchor">37</a>
    <a id="c4_3j"> </a>Notwithstanding his extraordinary
    mortifications, they appeared so trifling in his mind, that he
    called himself a sensual man, and would have every one else to be
    of the same opinion.<a

    indebted to so laudable a condescension.<a
      href="#fn_39"
      class="anchor">39</a>
    He dreaded praise so much, that in prayer, as was his custom, with
    hands lifted up to heaven, when sometimes he apprehended
    observation, he would suddenly drop them down.<a id="c4_3l">
    </a>He was always ready to blame himself, and saw nothing
    praiseworthy in others which did not serve him for an occasion to
    censure his own lukewarmness.<a

    On a visit of three solitaries wanting instruction, one of them
    said, “Father, what shall I&nbsp;do to shun hell-fire?” He made no
    reply. “And for my part,” added another, “how shall I&nbsp;escape
    the gnashing of teeth, and the worm that never dies?” “What also
    will become of me,” concluded the third, “for every time
    I&nbsp;think on utter darkness I&nbsp;am ready to die with fear?”
    Then the saint breaking silence, answered, “I&nbsp;confess that
    these are subjects which never employ my thoughts, and as
    I&nbsp;know that God is merciful, I&nbsp;trust he will have
    compassion on me. You are happy,” he added, “and I&nbsp;envy your
    virtue. You speak of the torments of hell, and your fears on this
    account must be powerful guards against the admission of sin.
    Alas! then, it is I&nbsp;should exclaim, What shall become of me?
    I,&nbsp;who am so insensible as never even to reflect on the place
    of torments destined to punish the wicked after death. Undoubtedly
    this is the reason I&nbsp;am guilty of so much sin.”<a id="c4_3m">
    </a>The solitaries retired much edified with this humble reply.<a
      href="#fn_41"

    The saint said one time, “I&nbsp;am now thirty years praying daily
    that my Lord Jesus may preserve me from saying an idle word, and
    yet I&nbsp;am always relapsing.”<a id="c4_3n"> </a>This could only
    be the language which humility dictates; for he was singularly
    observant of the times of retirement and silence, and kept his
    cell constantly locked to avoid interruption, and always gave his
    answers to those who asked his advice in the fewest words.<a
      href="#fn_42"

    <a id="c4_3o"> </a>The servant of God, worn out with sickness and
    old age, yielded at last to his disciple Abraham’s advice, and

    Here he received a visit from Ammon, or Amun, abbot of Raithe,
    who, observing his affliction for being absent from his retreat,
    endeavored to comfort him by representing that his present ill
    state of health wanted the remedies which could not be applied in
    the desert. “What do you say,” returned the saint, with a
    countenance full of grief, “was not the ease of mind
    I&nbsp;enjoyed there everything for my comfort?” He was not at
    ease till he returned to his retreat, where he finished his holy
    course. The solitaries of the desert assisting at his agony, heard
    him, as Rufinus relates, cry out, “Behold, abbot Antony, the choir
    of prophets and the angels come to take my soul.” At the same time
    his countenance shone, and being some time interiorly recollected
    with God, he cried out anew, “Behold! our Lord comes for me.”<a

    He died about the year 429, after a retreat of at least sixty-two
    years in St.&nbsp;Antony’s Mount. His feast is inserted in the
    Greek Menologies on the 6th of July; and in some of the Latin
    Calendars on the 4th of the same month. See Rosweide, Cotelier,

    This saint must not be confounded with two other Sisoes, who lived
    in the same age. One, surnamed the Theban, lived at Calamon, in
    the territory of Arsinoe. Another had his cell at Petra. It is of
    Sisoes the Theban that the following passage is related, though
    some authors by mistake have ascribed it to St.&nbsp;Sisoes of
    Sceté. A&nbsp;certain recluse having received some offence, went
    to Sisoes to tell him that he must have revenge. The holy old man
    conjured him to leave his revenge to God, to pardon his brother,
    and forget the injury he had received. But seeing that his advice
    had no weight with him, “At least,” said he, “let us both join in
    an address to God,” then standing up, he prayed thus aloud: “Lord,
    we no longer want your care of our interests or your protection,
    since this monk maintains that we can and ought to be our own
    avengers.”<a id="c4_3q"> </a>This extraordinary petition
    exceedingly moved the poor recluse, and throwing himself at the
    saint’s feet, he begged his pardon, protesting that from that
    moment he would forget he had ever been injured.<a
      href="#fn_45"
      class="anchor">45</a>
    This holy man loved retirement so much that he delayed not a
    moment even in the church after the mass to hasten to his cell.
    This was not to indulge self-love or an affected singularity, but
    to shun the danger of dissipation, and enjoy in silence and prayer
    the sweet conversation of God. For at proper seasons, especially
    when charity required it, he was far from being backward in giving
    himself to the duties of society. Such was his self-denial that he
    seldom or ever eat bread.<a id="c4_3r"> </a>However, being invited
    one time by the neighboring solitaries to a small repast, in
    condescension, and to show how little he was guided by self-will,
    observing that it would be agreeable, “I&nbsp;will eat,” said he,
    “bread, or anything you lay before me.”<a

    ABBESS OF BLANGY IN ARTOIS.</p>
  <p>
    She was the daughter of count Rigobert and Ursana, related to one
    of the kings of Kent in England. In the twentieth year of her age
    she was married to Sigefroi, by whom she had five daughters, two
    of whom, Gertrude and Deotila, were saints. After her husband’s
    death, she put on the veil in the nunnery which she had built at
    Blangy in Artois, a little distance from Hesdin. Her daughters
    Gertrude and Deotila followed her example. She was persecuted by
    Roger or Rotgar, who endeavored to asperse her with king
    Thierri&nbsp;III. to revenge his being refused Gertrude in
    marriage. But this prince, convinced of the innocence of Bertha,
    then abbess over her nunnery, gave her a kind reception, and took
    her under his protection. On her return to Blangy, Bertha finished
    her nunnery, and caused three churches to be built, one in honor
    of St.&nbsp;Omer, another she called after St.&nbsp;Vaast, and the
    third in honor of St.&nbsp;Martin of Tours. And then, after
    establishing a regular observance in her community, she left

  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1387.</p>
  <p>
    The most illustrious houses of the dukes and counts of Luxemburg
    and St.&nbsp;Pol, not only have held for several centuries the
    first rank among the nobility of the Low Countries, but vie with
    most royal families in Europe; the former having given five
    emperors to the Germans, several kings to Hungary and Bohemia, a
    queen to France, and innumerable renowned heroes, whose great
    actions are famous in the histories of Europe and the East. But
    none of their exploits have reflected so great a lustre on these
    families as the humility of our Saint Peter. He was son to Guy of
    Luxemburg, count of Ligny, and to Maud, countess of St.&nbsp;Pol;
    and was born at Ligny, a small town in Lorrain, in the diocess of
    Toul, in 1369. He was nearly related to the emperor Wenceslas,
    Sigismund, king of Hungary, and Charles&nbsp;VI., king of
    France.<a id="c5_1a"> </a>He lost his pious father at three years
    of age, and his most virtuous mother a year after; but his devout
    aunt, the countess of Orgieres and countess dowager of
    St.&nbsp;Pol,<a
      href="#fn_48"
      class="anchor">48</a>
    took care of his education, and made a prudent choice of most
    virtuous persons whom she placed about him. By the excellent
    example and precepts of his masters, and the strong impressions of
    an early grace, he seemed formed by nature to perfect virtue. In
    his tender age the least sallies of the passions seemed rather
    prevented than subdued; and his ardor in the pursuit of virtue so
    far surpassed the ordinary capacity of children of his tender age,
    that it was a matter of astonishment to all that knew him. His
    assiduity and fervor in prayer, his secret self-denials, great
    abstemiousness, and, above all, his love of humility in an age
    when others are usually governed only by the senses, seemed a
    miracle of divine grace. He made a private vow of perpetual
    chastity before he was seven years of age, and he contrived by a
    hundred little artifices that no poor person should ever be
    dismissed wherever he was without an alms. At ten years of age he
    was sent to Paris, where he studied Latin, philosophy, and the
    canon law. In the meantime his eldest brother Valeran, count of
    St.&nbsp;Pol, was taken prisoner by the English in a battle in
    which they defeated the French and Flemings in Flanders. Upon the
    news that his brother was made prisoner and sent to Calais, Peter,
    in 1381, interrupted his studies, went over to London, and
    delivered himself up a hostage for his brother till his ransom
    should be paid. The English were charmed with his extraordinary
    virtue, and after he had stayed a year in London, generously gave
    him his liberty, saying his word was a sufficient pledge and
    security for the ransom stipulated. King Richard&nbsp;II. invited
    him to his court; but Peter excused himself, and hastened back to
    Paris to his studies. His watchings and fasts were very austere,
    and he made no visits but such as were indispensable, or to
    persons of extraordinary virtue, from whose conversation and
    example he might draw great spiritual advantage for the benefit of
    his own soul. With this view he often resorted to Philip of
    Maisiers, a person eminently endowed with the double spirit of
    penance and prayer, who, having been formerly chancellor of the
    kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, led for twenty-five years a
    retired life in the convent of the Celestines in Paris, without
    taking any vows, or professing that Order. From this devout
    servant of God our saint received important instructions and
    advice, which gave him great light in the exercises of prayer,
    and in the paths of interior spiritual perfection.</p>
  <p>
    In 1383 his brother, the count of St.&nbsp;Pol, obtained for him a
    canonry in our Lady’s at Paris; which ecclesiastical preferment
    was to him a new motive to increase his fervor in the divine
    service. His devotion and assiduity in choir, his charity towards
    all, his innocence, his perfect spirit of mortification, and his
    meekness, edified exceedingly the whole city; and the modesty with
    which he endeavored to conceal his virtues was like a fine
    transparent veil through which they shone with redoubled lustre.
    His humility was most conspicuous, of which the following
    instance, among others, is recorded: When a young clerk refused to
    carry the cross at a solemn procession, the new canon took it up,
    and carried it with so much devotion, that the whole city was
    struck with admiration to see him. Peter strove only to advance in
    humility and Christian perfection: this was the sole point which
    he had in view in all his actions and undertakings; and he was
    very far from aspiring to the least ecclesiastical dignity. But
    the reputation of his extraordinary sanctity reaching Avignon,
    Clement&nbsp;VII., who, in the great schism, was acknowledged by
    France for true pope, nominated him archdeacon of Dreux, in the
    diocess of Chartres, and soon after, in 1384, bishop of Metz, his
    great sanctity and prudence seeming to many a sufficient reason
    for dispensing with his want of age. But Peter’s reluctance and
    remonstrances could only be overcome by a scruple which was much
    exaggerated to him, that by too obstinate a disobedience he would
    offend God. He made his public entry at Metz barefoot, and riding
    on an ass, to imitate the humility of our Redeemer. He would
    suffer no other magnificence on that occasion than the
    distribution of great arms and largesses among the poor; nor would
    he admit any attendants but what might inspire modesty and
    piety.</p>
  <p>
    He had no sooner taken possession of his church than with the
    suffragan, Bertrand, a Dominican, who was given him for his
    assistant, and consecrated bishop of Thessaly, he performed the
    visitation of his diocess, in which he everywhere corrected
    abuses, and gave astonishing proofs of his zeal, activity, and
    prudence. He divided his revenues into three parts, allotting one
    to his church, a second to the poor, and reserving a third for
    himself and family, though the greatest share of this he added to
    the portion of the poor. On fast-days commanded by the Church he
    took no other sustenance than bread and water; and he fasted in
    the same austere manner all Advent, and all Mondays, Fridays, and
    Saturdays throughout the year. When several towns had revolted
    from him and created for themselves new magistrates, his brother,
    the count of St.&nbsp;Pol, reduced them to their duty by force of
    arms. The holy bishop was exceedingly mortified at this accident,
    and out of his own patrimony made amends to every one even among
    the rebels for all losses they had sustained, which unparalleled
    charity gained him all their hearts. Though he was judged, by
    those who were best acquainted with his interior, during his whole
    life never to have stained his baptismal innocence by any mortal
    sin, he had so high an idea of the purity in which a soul ought
    always to appear in the divine presence, especially when she
    approaches the holy mysteries, that he went every day to
    confession with extraordinary compunction, and bewailed the least
    imperfections with many tears. The very shadow of the least sloth
    or failing in any action affrighted him. In the year 1384,
    Clement&nbsp;VII., soon after he had nominated him bishop, created
    him cardinal, under the title of St.&nbsp;George, and in 1386
    called him to Avignon, and obliged him to reside there near his
    person. Peter continued all his former austerities in the midst of
    a court, till Clement commanded him to mitigate them for the sake
    of his health, which seemed to be in a declining condition. His
    answer was: “Holy Father, I&nbsp;shall always be an unprofitable
    servant, but I&nbsp;can at least obey.” He desired to compensate
    for what he lost in the practices of penance by redoubling his
    alms-deeds. By his excessive charities his purse was always empty;
    his table was most frugal, his family very small, his furniture
    mean, and his clothes poor, and these he never changed till they
    were worn out. It seemed that he could not increase his alms, yet
    he found means to do it by distributing his little furniture and
    his equipage among the indigent, and selling for them the
    episcopal ring which he wore on his finger. Everything about him
    breathed an extraordinary spirit of poverty, and published his
    affection for the poor. At his death his whole treasure amounted
    only to twenty-pence. In all his actions he seemed attentive only
    to God; and he fell into raptures sometimes in the street, or
    whilst he waited on the pope at court. An ancient picture of the
    saint is kept in the collegiate church of our Lady at Autun, in
    which he is painted in an ecstasy, and in which are written these
    words which he was accustomed frequently to repeat: “Contempt of
    the world, contempt of thyself: rejoice in thy own contempt, but
    despise no other person.”</p>
  <p>
    Ten months after his promotion to the dignity of cardinal, the
    saint was seized with a sharp fever, which so much undermined his
    constitution that his imperfect recovery was succeeded by a
    dangerous slow fever. For his health he was advised to retire to
    Villeneuve, an agreeable town situate opposite to Avignon, on the
    other side of the Rhone. He was glad by this opportunity to see
    himself removed from the noise and hurry of the court. During his
    last illness he went to confession twice every day; never passed a
    day without receiving the holy communion; and the constant union
    of his soul with God, and the tenderness of his devotion, seemed
    continually to increase as he drew near his end. His brother
    Andrew coming to see him, the saint spoke to him with such energy
    on the vanity of the world, and on the advantages of piety, that
    his words left a deep impression on his heart during his whole
    life. This brother afterward taking holy orders was made bishop of
    Cambray, and became one of the most holy prelates of that age. Our
    saint recommended to him in particular his sister Jane of
    Luxemburg, whom he had induced to make a vow of perpetual
    chastity, and whose whole life was a perfect pattern of Christian
    perfection. Saint Peter sent her by this brother a small treatise
    containing certain rules of perfection, which he had drawn up for
    her. Finding his strength quite exhausted, he desired and received
    the last sacraments; after which he called all his servants, and
    as they stood weeping round his bed, he begged their pardon for
    not having edified them by his example as he ought to have done.
    He then conjured them all to promise to do for his sake one thing
    which he was going to ask of them. To this they most readily
    engaged themselves. But they were much surprised when he ordered
    them to take a discipline which lay under his pillow, and every
    one to give him many stripes on his back, in punishment for the
    faults he had committed in regard to them, who were, as he said,
    his brethren in Christ and his masters. Notwithstanding their
    extreme unwillingness they were obliged to comply with his request
    in order to satisfy him. After this act of penance and
    humiliation, he conversed with God in silent prayer till he gave
    up his innocent soul into his hands, on the 2d of July, 1387,
    being eighteen years old, wanting eighteen days. Though he had the
    administration of a diocess, he had not received priestly orders,
    but seems to have been deacon, and his dalmatic is shown at
    Avignon. He was buried without pomp, according to his orders, in
    the church-yard of St.&nbsp;Michael.</p>
  <p>
    On account of many miracles that were wrought both before and
    after his interment, the citizens of Avignon built a rich chapel
    over his grave. The convent and church of the Celestines have been
    since built over that very spot, and in this church is the saint’s
    body at present enshrined under a stately mausoleum. The history
    of the miracles which have been wrought at his tomb fills whole
    volumes. A&nbsp;famous one in 1432, moved the city of Avignon to
    choose him for its patron. It is related as follows: A&nbsp;child
    about twelve years old fell from a high tower in the palace of
    Avignon upon a sharp rock, by which fall his skull was split, his
    brains dashed out, and his body terribly bruised. The father of
    the child, almost distracted at this accident, ran to the place,
    and falling on his knees with many tears, implored the
    intercession of St.&nbsp;Peter. Then gathering up the scattered
    bloody pieces of the child’s skull, he carried them with the body
    in a sack, and laid them on the saint’s tomb. The people and the
    Celestine monks joined their earnest prayers; and after some time
    the child returned to life, and was placed upon the altar that all
    might see him thus wonderfully raised from the dead. This miracle
    happened on the 5th of July, on which day the festival of the
    saint has ever since been celebrated at Avignon. After juridical
    informations on his life and miracles, the bull of his
    beatification was published by the true pope Clement&nbsp;VII. of
    the family of Medicis, in 1527.</p>

    St.&nbsp;Peter was a saint from the cradle, because he always
    strove to live only for God, and his divine honor. If one spark of
    that ardent love of God which inflamed the saints in their actions
    animated our breasts, it would give wings to our souls in all we
    do. We should devote ourselves every moment to God with our whole
    strength; and by our fidelity, and by the purity and fervor of our
    intention, we should with the saints make all our actions perfect
    sacrifices of our hearts to him.<a id="c5_1b"> </a>“God considers

    SAINT MODWENA, A&nbsp;NOBLE&nbsp;IRISH&nbsp;VIRGIN.</h3>
  <p>
    Having led a religious life several years in her own country, she
    came into England in the reign of king Ethelwolf, about the year
    840. That pious and great king being acquainted with her sanctity,
    committed to her care the education of his daughter Editha, and
    founded for her the monastery of Pollesworth, near the forest of
    Arden in Warwickshire, which flourished till the dissolution,
    bearing usually the name of St.&nbsp;Editha, its patroness and
    second abbess. St.&nbsp;Modwena had before established two famous
    nunneries in Scotland, one at Stirling, the other in Edinburgh.
    She made some other pious foundations in England, but to apply
    herself more perfectly to the sanctification of her own soul, she
    led during seven years in anachoretical life in an isle in the
    Trent, which was called Andresey from the apostle St.&nbsp;Andrew,
    in whose honor she procured her oratory to be dedicated. When the
    great abbey of Burton-upon-Trent was founded in the year 1004, it
    was dedicated under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin and
    St.&nbsp;Modwena, and was enriched with the relics of this saint,
    which were translated thither from Andresey; whence Leland calls
    the monastery of Burton Modwenestow. See Pinius the Bollandist,

    ABOUT THE YEAR 450.</p>
  <p>
    The name of Palladius shows this saint to have been a Roman, and
    most authors agree that he was deacon of the church of Rome. At
    least St.&nbsp;Prosper in his chronicle informs us, that when
    Agricola, a noted Pelagian, had corrupted the churches of Britain
    with the insinuation of that pestilential heresy, pope Celestine,
    at the instance of Palladius the deacon, in 429, sent thither
    St.&nbsp;Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, in quality of his legate,
    who, having ejected the heretics, brought back the Britons to the
    Catholic faith. The concern of Palladius for these islands stopped
    not here; for it seems not to be doubted, but it was the same
    person of whom St.&nbsp;Prosper again speaks, when he afterwards
    says, that in 431 pope Celestine sent Palladius, the first bishop,
    to the Scots then believing in Christ.<a id="c6_1a"> </a>From the
    lives of SS.&nbsp;Albeus, Declan, Ibar, and Kiaran Saigir, Usher
    shows<a
      href="#fn_52"
      class="anchor">52</a>
    that these four saints preached separately in different parts of
    Ireland, which was their native country before the mission of
    St.&nbsp;Patrick. St.&nbsp;Ibar had been converted to the faith in
    Britain; the other three had been instructed at Rome, and were
    directed thence back into their own country, and according to the
    histories of their lives, were all honored with the episcopal
    character. St.&nbsp;Kiaran Saigir (who is commemorated on the 5th
    of March) preceded St.&nbsp;Patrick in preaching the gospel to the
    Ossorians, and was seventy-five years of age on St.&nbsp;Patrick’s
    arrival in Ireland. Hence it is easy to understand what is said of
    St.&nbsp;Palladius, that he was sent bishop to the Scots believing
    in Christ: though the number of Christians among them must have
    been then very small.<a id="c6_1b"> </a>St.&nbsp;Prosper, in his
    book against the <i>Author of the conferences</i>,<a
      href="#fn_53"
      class="anchor">53</a>
    having commended pope Celestine for his care in delivering Britain
    from the Pelagian heresy, adds, that “he also ordained a bishop
    for the Scots, and thus, whilst he endeavored to preserve the
    Roman island <i>Catholic</i>, he likewise made a barbarous island
    <i>Christian</i>.” Usher observes that this can be understood only
    of Ireland; for though part of North-Britain was never subject to
    the Romans, and the greatest part of it was then inhabited by the
    Picts, yet it never could be called a distinct island. It is also
    clear from Tertullian, Eusebius, St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, and others,
    that the light of the gospel had penetrated among the Picts beyond
    the Roman territories in Britain, near the times of the apostles.
    These people, therefore, who had lately begun to receive some
    tincture of the faith when our saint undertook his mission, were
    doubtless the Scots who were settled in Ireland.</p>
  <p>
    The Irish writers of the lives of St.&nbsp;Patrick say, that
    Palladius had preached in Ireland a little before
    St.&nbsp;Patrick, but that he was soon banished by the king of
    Leinster, and returned to North Britain, where they tell us he had
    first opened his mission.<a id="c6_1c"> </a>It seems not to be
    doubted but he was sent to the whole nation of the Scots, several
    colonies of whom had passed from Ireland into North Britain, and
    possessed themselves of part of the country, since called
    Scotland.<a
      href="#fn_54"
      class="anchor">54</a>
    <a id="c6_1d"> </a>After St.&nbsp;Palladius had left Ireland, he
    arrived among the Scots in North Britain, according to St.&nbsp;
    Prosper, in the consulate of Bassus and Antiochus, in the year of
    Christ 431.<a
      href="#fn_55"
      class="anchor">55</a>
    He preached there with great zeal, and formed a considerable
    church. The Scottish historians tell us, that the faith was
    planted in North Britain about the year 200, in the time of king
    Donald, when Victor was pope of Rome.<a id="c6_1e"> </a>But they
    all acknowledge that Palladius was the first bishop in that
    country, and style him their first apostle.<a
      href="#fn_56"
      class="anchor">56</a>
    The saint died at Fordun, the capital town of the little county of
    Mernis, fifteen miles from Aberdeen to the south, about the year
    450.<a id="c6_1f"> </a>His relics were preserved with religious
    respect in the monastery of Fordun, as Hector Boetius<a
      href="#fn_57"
      class="anchor">57</a>
    and Camden testify. In the year 1409, William Scenes, archbishop
    of St.&nbsp;Andrew’s and primate of Scotland, enclosed them in a
    new shrine enriched with gold and precious stones. His festival is
    marked on the 6th of July in the Breviary of Aberdeen and the
    Scottish Calendars; but in some of the English on the 15th of
    December. Scottish writers, and calendars of the middle ages,
    mention St.&nbsp;Servanus and St.&nbsp;Ternan as disciples of
    St.&nbsp;Palladius, and by him made bishops, the former of Orkney,
    the latter of the Picts. But from Usher’s chronology it appears
    that they both lived later.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    It is easy to conceive how painful and laborious the mission of
    this saint must have been; but where there is ardent love, labor
    seems a pleasure, and either is not felt or is a delight. It is a
    mark of sloth and impatience for a man to count his labors, or so
    much as to think of pains or sufferings in so glorious an
    undertaking. St.&nbsp;Palladius surmounted every obstacle which a
    fierce nation had opposed to the establishment of the kingdom of
    Jesus Christ. Ought not our hearts to be impressed with the most
    lively sentiments of love and gratitude to our merciful God, for
    having raised up such great and zealous men, by whose ministry the
    light of true faith has been conveyed to us.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;JULIAN, ANCHORET.</h3>
  <p>
    This saint was carried away captive from some Western country when
    he was very young, and sold for a slave in Syria. For some years
    he much aggravated the weight of his chains by his impatience
    under them; till having the happiness to receive the light of
    faith he found them exceedingly lightened by the comfort which
    religion afforded him. A&nbsp;right use of his afflictions from
    that moment contributed much to the sanctification of his soul.
    Not long after, he recovered his liberty by the death of his
    master, and immediately in the fervor of his devotion dedicated
    himself to the service of God in an austere monastery in
    Mesopotamia. He frequently resorted to the great St.&nbsp;Ephrem
    for advice and instructions in the exercises of virtue; and that
    holy man went often to see him, that he might edify himself by his
    saintly conversation. This learned doctor of the Syriac church
    tells us, that he could not forbear always admiring the sublime
    sentiments and spiritual lights with which God favored a man who
    appeared in the eyes of the world ignorant and a barbarian. Julian
    was of a robust body, inured to labor, but he weakened and
    emaciated it by great austerities. He worked with his hands,
    making sails for ships; and wept almost continually at the
    consideration of his past sins, and of the divine judgments.
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem tells us that he often admired to find that in the
    copies of the holy Bible after Julian had used them some days,
    several words were effaced, and others rendered scarcely legible,
    though the manuscripts were entire and fair before; and that the
    holy man candidly confessed to him when he one day asked him the
    reason, that the tears which he shed in reading often blotted out
    letters and words. Our saint always looked upon himself as a
    criminal, trembling, and expecting every moment the coming of his
    judge to call him to an account. It is easy to imagine how remote
    such a disposition of mind was from being capable of entertaining
    the very thought of amusements. His extreme humility appeared in
    his words, dress, and all his actions. He had much to suffer from
    certain tepid and slothful monks, but regarded himself as happy to
    meet with so favorable opportunities of redeeming his sins, and of
    exercising acts of penance, patience, meekness, and charity.
    Prayer was almost the uninterrupted employment of his heart. He
    made in his little cell a kind of a sepulchre, where he lived
    retired for greater solitude whenever his presence was not
    required at duties of the community. He assisted at the divine
    office without ever moving his body, keeping his whole attention
    fixed on God, as if he had been standing before the tribunal of
    his sovereign judge. Saint Ephrem assures us that God honored him
    with the gift of miracles.<a id="c6_2a"> </a>Sozomen writes<a
      href="#fn_58"
      class="anchor">58</a>
    that his life was so austere, that he seemed almost to live
    without a body. Thus he spent twenty-five years in his monastery,
    purifying his soul by patience, obedience, and the labors of
    penance. He passed to a glorious immortality about the year 370.

    ST.&nbsp;SEXBURGH, ABBESS.</h3>
  <p>
    She was daughter of Anna the religious king of the East-Angles,
    and his devout queen Hereswide, sister to St.&nbsp;Hilda.
    A&nbsp;pious education laid in her the foundation of that eminent
    sanctity for which she was most conspicuous during the whole
    course of her life. She was given in marriage to Ercombert, king
    of Kent, a prince of excellent dispositions, which she contributed
    exceedingly to improve by her counsels and example. She had a
    great share in all his zealous undertakings for promoting virtue
    and the happiness of his people, especially in extirpating the
    last remains of idolatry in his dominions, and in enforcing the
    observance of Lent, and other precepts of the Church, by wholesome
    laws. Her virtue commanded the reverence, and her humility and
    devotion raised the admiration of all her subjects; and her
    goodness and unbounded charity gained her the love of all,
    especially the poor. She had a longing desire to consecrate
    herself wholly to God in religious retirement, and that others at
    least might attend the divine service for her night and day
    without impediment, she began in her husband’s lifetime to found a
    monastery of holy virgins in the isle of Sheppey, on the coast of
    Kent, which she finished after his death in 664, whilst her son
    Egbert sat on the throne. Here she assembled seventy-four nuns,
    but hearing of the great sanctity of St.&nbsp;Etheldreda at Ely,
    and being desirous to live in greater obscurity, and to be more at
    liberty to employ all her thoughts on heaven, she left the kingdom
    of Kent, and retired to Ely before the year 679, in which she was
    chosen to succeed her sister St.&nbsp;Etheldreda, or Audry, in the
    government of that house. Sixteen years after she caused the body
    of that saint to be taken up, and passed herself to bliss in a
    good old age, on the 6th of July, toward the end of the seventh
    century. Her monastery in Sheppey, called Le Mynstre in Sheppey,
    was destroyed by the Danes, but rebuilt in 1130, and consecrated
    by William, archbishop of Canterbury, in honor of the Blessed
    Virgin Mary and St.&nbsp;Sexburgh; and it subsisted in the hands
    of Benedictin nuns till the dissolution of abbeys. St.&nbsp;
    Ermenilda, daughter of king Ercombert and St.&nbsp;Sexburgh, was
    married to Wulpher, king of Mercia, but after his death retired
    to Ely, near her mother and her two aunts St.&nbsp;Audry and
    St.&nbsp;Withburg, three daughters of king Anna.
    St.&nbsp;Wereburgh, daughter of St.&nbsp;Ermenilda and king
    Wulpher, was a nun at Hearburgh (which seems to have been near
    Stanford or Croyland). Her relics were venerated at Hearburgh,
    till in the ninth century they were removed to Leicester. See the

  <p>
    This learned father and apostolic man flourished in the second
    age. He was by birth a Sicilian, by profession a stoic
    philosopher. For his eloquence he is styled by St.&nbsp;Clement of
    Alexandria the Sicilian Bee. His esteem for virtue led him into an
    acquaintance with the Christians, and being charmed with the
    innocence and sanctity of their conversation he opened his eyes to
    the truth. He studied the holy scriptures under the disciples of
    the apostles, and his thirst after sacred learning brought him to
    Alexandria in Egypt, where the disciples of St.&nbsp;Mark had
    instituted a celebrated school of the Christian doctrine. Pantænus
    sought not to display his talents in that great mart of literature
    and commerce; but his great progress in sacred learning was after
    some time discovered, and he was drawn out of that obscurity in
    which his humility sought to live buried. Being placed at the head
    of the Christian school some time before the year 179, which was
    the first of Commodus, by his learning and excellent manner of
    teaching he raised its reputation above all the schools of the
    philosophers, and the lessons which he read, and which were
    gathered from the flowers of the prophets and apostles, conveyed
    light and knowledge into the minds of all his hearers, as
    St.&nbsp;Clement of Alexandria, his eminent scholar, says of him.
    The Indians who traded to Alexandria, entreated him to pay their
    country a visit, in order to confute their Brachmans. Hereupon he
    forsook his school, and was established by Demetrius, who was made
    bishop of Alexandria in 189, preacher of the gospel to the Eastern
    nations. Eusebius tells us that St.&nbsp;Pantænus found some seeds
    of the faith already sown in the Indies, and a book of the gospel
    of St.&nbsp;Matthew in Hebrew, which St.&nbsp;Bartholomew had
    carried thither. He brought it back with him to Alexandria,
    whither he returned after he had zealously employed some years in
    instructing the Indians in the faith.<a id="c7_1a"> </a>The public
    school was at that time governed by St.&nbsp;Clement, but
    St.&nbsp;Pantænus continued to teach in private till in the reign
    of Caracalla, consequently before the year 216, he closed a noble
    and excellent life by a happy death, as Rufinus writes.<a

    Into what contradictions and gross errors did they fall, even
    about the divinity itself and the sovereign good! To how many
    vices did they give the name of virtues! How many crimes did they
    canonize! It is true they showed indeed a zeal for justice, a
    contempt of riches and pleasures, moderation in prosperity,
    patience in adversities, generosity, courage, and
    disinterestedness. But these were rather shadows and phantoms than
    real virtues, if they sprang from a principle of vanity and pride,
    or were infected with the poison of interestedness or any other
    vitiated intention, which they often betrayed, nay, sometimes

    SAINT WILLIBALD, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;AICHSTADT,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was son of the holy king St.&nbsp;Richard, and was born about
    the year 704 in the kingdom of the West-Saxons, about the place
    where Southampton now stands. When he was three years old his life
    was despaired of in a violent sickness; but when all natural
    remedies proved unsuccessful, his parents carried him and laid him
    at the foot of a great cross which was erected in a public place
    near their house, according to the custom in Catholic countries to
    this day. There they poured forth their prayers with great fervor,
    and made a promise to God that in case the child recovered they
    would consecrate him to the divine service. God accepted their
    pious offering, and the child was immediately restored to his
    health. St.&nbsp;Richard kept the child two years longer at home,
    but only regarded him as a sacred depositum committed to him by
    God; and when he was five years old placed him under the abbot
    Egbald, and other holy tutors in the monastery of Waltheim. The
    young saint, from the first use of his reason, in all his thoughts
    and actions seemed to aspire only to heaven, and his heart seemed
    full only of God and his holy love. He left this monastery about
    the year 721, when he was seventeen years old, and his brother
    Winibald nineteen, to accompany his father and brother in a
    pilgrimage of devotion to the tombs of the apostles at Rome, and
    to the Holy Land. They visited many churches in France on their
    road; but St.&nbsp;Richard died at Lucca, where his relics are
    still venerated in the church of St.&nbsp;Fridian, and he is
    commemorated in the Roman Martyrology on the 7th of February. The
    two sons went on to Rome, and there took the monastic habit.</p>
  <p>
    Above two years after this, Winibald having been obliged to return
    to England, St.&nbsp;Willibald with two or three young Englishmen
    set out to visit the holy places which Christ had sanctified by
    his sacred presence on earth. They added most severe
    mortifications to the incredible fatigues of their journey, living
    only on bread and water, and at land using no other bed than the
    bare ground. They sailed first to Cyprus and thence into Syria. At
    Emesa St.&nbsp;Willibald was taken by the Saracens for a spy, was
    loaded with irons, and suffered much in severe confinement for
    several months, till certain persons who were charmed with his
    wonderful virtue, and moved with compassion for his disaster,
    satisfied the caliph of his innocence, and procured his
    enlargement. The holy pilgrims expressed their gratitude to their
    benefactors, and pursued their journey to the holy places. They
    resolved in visiting them to follow our Divine Redeemer in the
    course of his mortal life; and therefore they began their
    devotions at Nazareth. Our saint passed there some days with his
    companions in the continual contemplation of the infinite mercies
    of God in the great mystery of the incarnation; and the sight of
    the place in which it was wrought drew from his eyes streams of
    devout tears during all the time of his stay in that town. From
    Nazareth he went to Bethlehem, and thence into Egypt, making no
    account of the fatigues and hardships of his journey, and
    assiduously meditating on what our Blessed Redeemer had suffered
    in the same. He returned to Nazareth, and thence travelled to
    Cana, Capharnaum, and Jerusalem. In this last place he made a long
    stay to satisfy his fervor in adoring Christ in the places where
    he wrought so many great mysteries, particularly on the mountains
    of Calvary and Olivet, the theatres of his sacred death and
    ascension. He likewise visited all the famous monasteries, lauras,
    and hermitages in that country, with an ardent desire of learning
    and imitating all the most perfect practices of virtue, and
    whatever might seem most conducive to the sanctification of his
    soul. The tender and lively sentiments of devotion with which his
    fervent contemplation on the holy mysteries of our redemption
    inspired him at the sight of all those sacred places, filled his
    devout soul with heavenly consolations, and made on it strong and
    lasting impressions. In his return a severe sickness at Acon
    exercised his patience and resignation. After seven years employed
    in this pilgrimage he arrived safe with his companions in
    Italy.</p>
  <p>
    The celebrated monastery of Mount Cassino having been lately
    repaired by pope Gregory&nbsp;II. the saint chose that house for
    his residence, and his fervent example contributed very much to
    settle in it the primitive spirit of its holy institute during the
    ten years that he lived there. He was first appointed sacristan,
    afterward dean or superior over ten monks, and during the last
    eight years porter, which was an office of great trust and
    importance, and required a rooted habit of virtue which might
    suffer no abatement by external employs and frequent commerce with
    seculars. It happened that in 738 St.&nbsp;Boniface coming to Rome
    begged of pope Gregory&nbsp;III. that Willibald, who was his
    cousin, might be sent to assist him in his missions in Germany.
    The pope desired to see the monk, and was much delighted with the
    history of his travels, and edified with his virtue. In the close
    of their conversation he acquainted him of bishop Boniface’s
    request. Willibald desired to go back at least to obtain the leave
    and blessing of his abbot; but the pope told him his order
    sufficed, and commanded him to go without more ado into Germany.
    The saint replied that he was ready to go wheresoever his holiness
    should think fit. Accordingly he set out for Thuringia where
    St.&nbsp;Boniface then was, by whom he was ordained priest. His
    labors in the country about Aichstadt, in Franconia and Bavaria,
    were crowned with incredible success, and he was no less powerful
    in words than in works.</p>
  <p>
    In 746 he was consecrated by St.&nbsp;Boniface bishop of
    Aichstadt. This dignity gave his humility much to suffer, but it
    exceedingly excited his zeal. The cultivation of so rough a
    vineyard was a laborious and painful task; but his heroic patience
    and invincible meekness overcame all difficulties. His charity was
    most tender and compassionate, and he had a singular talent in
    comforting the afflicted. He founded a monastery which resembled
    in discipline that of Mount Cassino, to which he often retired.
    But his love of solitude diminished not his pastoral solicitude
    for his flock. He was attentive to all their spiritual
    necessities, he visited often every part of his charge, and
    instructed all his people with indefatigable zeal and charity. His
    fasts were most austere, nor did he allow himself any indulgence
    in them or in his labors on account of his great age, till his
    strength was entirely exhausted. Having labored almost forty-five
    years in regulating and sanctifying his diocess, he died at
    Aichstadt on the 7th of June, 790, being eighty-seven years old.
    He was honored with miracles, and buried in his own cathedral.
    Pope Leo&nbsp;VII. canonized him in 938. In 1270 the bishop
    Hildebrand built a church in his honor, into which his relics were
    translated, and are honorably preserved to this day; but a portion
    is honored at Furnes in Flanders. See the three lives of
    St.&nbsp;Willibald written by contemporary authors, especially
    that by a nun of his sister St.&nbsp;Walburga’s monastery. She
    gives from the saint’s own relation a curious and useful
    description of the Holy Land, as it stood in that age; which is
    rendered more curious by the notes of Mabillon, and those of
    Basnage in his edition of Canisius’s Lect. Antiquæ. On

    ST.&nbsp;FELIX, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;NANTES,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    The most illustrious among the bishops of Nantes was saint Felix,
    a person of the first rank in Aquitain, some say of Bourges in the
    First Aquitain; others more probably think of the Second Aquitain
    on the sea-coast and nearer Brittany. In the world he was more
    illustrious by his virtue, his eloquence, and learning, than by
    his dignities and high birth. The Greek language was as familiar
    to him as his own; he was a poet and orator, and seems from
    Fortunatus’s expression to have written a panegyric on the queen
    St.&nbsp;Radegundes in verse. He had been married when he was
    called to succeed Evemer, the holy bishop of Nantes, toward the
    close of the year 549, in the 37th year of his age. His zeal for
    discipline and good order appeared in the regulations he made for
    his own diocess, and in the decrees of the third council of Paris
    in 557, in the second of Tours in 566, and the fourth of Paris in
    573. His charity to the poor had no other bounds but those of
    their necessities, and considering that the revenues of the Church
    were the patrimony of the poor, he reserved to himself only the
    prudent and troublesome administration of them for their use. He
    sold for them and the Church his own patrimony, and made it his
    study and earnest endeavor that no one in his diocess should pass
    unrelieved in distress. His predecessor had formed a project of
    building a cathedral within the walls of the city of Nantes, which
    Felix executed in the most magnificent manner. Fortunatus
    describes it to have been composed of three naves, of which the
    middle was supported by great pillars. A&nbsp;great cupola was
    raised in the middle. The church was covered with tin, and within
    was only azure, gold, mosaic, paintings, pilasters, foliages,
    various figures, and other ornaments. Euphronius archbishop of
    Tours, and the bishops of Angers, Mans, Rennes, Poitiers, and
    Angouleme performed the dedication; no bishop of the Britons was
    invited to the ceremony; for which it appears that their commerce
    with the French was not entirely free. The Britons were then
    possessed of no lands in the diocess of Nantes except the
    territory of Croisic, in which was the palace of Aula Quiriaca or
    Guerrande, vulgarly Warand, probably so called from
    Guerech&nbsp;I. the British count of Vannes, who resided there.
    Canao, one of his successors, when Felix was made bishop, had put
    to death three of his brothers, and held a fourth named Macliau in
    prison. St.&nbsp;Felix by his intercession saved his life, and
    obtained his liberty. St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours complains that
    bishop Felix had been prepossessed by false informations against
    Peter, Gregory’s brother, and accused him of favoring an unworthy
    nephew; but in other places bears testimony to his eminent
    sanctity, which is much extolled by Fortunatus and others.
    Guerech&nbsp;II. count of Vannes, plundered the diocesses of
    Rennes and Vannes, and repulsed the troops which king Chilperic
    sent against him; but, at the entreaties of St.&nbsp;Felix,
    withdrew his forces, and made peace. The holy prelate died on the
    8th of January in 584, the seventieth year of his age, of his
    episcopal dignity thirty-three.</p>
  <p>
    He is honored at Nantes, of which he was the sixteenth bishop from
    St.&nbsp;Clair, on the 7th of July, the day of the translation of
    his relics. See Fortunatus, l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;4, 5, 6,&nbsp;7.

    ST.&nbsp;BENEDICT&nbsp;XI. POPE,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    His family name was Nicholas Bocasini. He was a native of Treviso,
    which city was then an independent commonwealth, but since the
    year 1336 is subject to that of Venice. He was born in 1240, and
    studied first at Treviso, and afterwards at Venice, where, at
    fourteen years of age, he took the habit of St.&nbsp;Dominick. He
    seemed desirous to set no bounds to his fervor and fidelity in the
    practice of every means of improving his soul daily in virtue:
    and, during fourteen years, enriched his mind with an uncommon
    store of sacred learning. After this term he was appointed
    professor and preacher at Venice and Bologna, and with incredible
    fruit communicated to others those spiritual riches which he had
    treasured up in silence and retirement, being always careful by
    the same means to preserve and increase his own stock. He wrote
    several sermons and comments on the holy scripture, which are
    still extant.<a id="c7_6a"> </a>He was chosen provincial of
    Lombardy, and, in 1296, the ninth general of his Order. On that
    occasion, by a pathetic circular letter,<a
      href="#fn_66"
      class="anchor">66</a>
    he exhorted his brethren to a love of poverty, humility,
    retirement, prayer, charity, and obedience. In 1297 he was sent by
    Boniface&nbsp;VIII. nuncio into France, to be the mediator of
    peace between that nation and the English; and was created
    cardinal during his residence there in 1298. Nothing but the
    strict command of his Holiness could have obliged him to accept
    that dignity, which cost him many tears. He was made soon after
    bishop of Ostia, and dean of the sacred college; and in 1301 went
    legate <i>a latere</i> into Hungary, to endeavor to compose the
    differences which divided that nation into factions, and had
    already laid it waste by a dreadful civil war; in which cardinal
    Boncasini succeeded to a miracle. He also abolished in that
    country several superstitious practices, and other abuses and
    scandals. He afterward exerted his zeal in Austria and at Venice,
    being successively legate in both those places.</p>
  <p>
    Boniface&nbsp;VIII. dying on the 11th of October, 1303, the
    cardinals entered the conclave on the 21st of the same month, and
    on the day following unanimously chose our saint pope. He was
    seized with trembling at the news; but being compelled to
    acquiesce, was crowned on the following Sunday. He continued his
    former practices of humility, mortification, and penance. When his
    mother came to his court in rich attire, he refused to see her
    till she had put on again her former mean apparel. Rome was at
    that time torn by civil divisions, especially by the factions of
    the Colonnas against the late pope, but the moderation, meekness,
    and prudence of our saint soon restored the whole country to
    perfect tranquillity. He pardoned the Colonnas and other rebels,
    Sciarra Colonna and William of Nogaret excepted, who remained
    under the former sentence of proscription. He pacified Denmark,
    and other kingdoms of the North, and appeased the State and Church
    of France. He reconciled the cities of Venice and Padua without
    effusion of blood. He joined his zealous endeavors with Helena,
    queen of Servia, in the conversion of her son Orosius. This good
    pope died the martyr of peace, to make which reign over the whole
    Christian world he seemed only to have lived. Having sat only
    eight months and seventeen days, he departed this life at Perugia,
    on the 6th of July, in the year of our Lord, 1304, of his age
    sixty-three. Some say he died of poison secretly given him by the
    contrivance of certain wicked men who were enemies to the public
    tranquillity. He was honored by miracles, examined and approved by
    the bishop of Perugia, and attested by Platina and other
    historians. See Conc. t.&nbsp;10, also his life collected by Pagi,
    in his Annals, and in an express work by the late learned
    Dominican, F.&nbsp;Peter Thomas Campana; and Vie de

  <h3 class="sthd">
    SAINT ELIZABETH, QUEEN&nbsp;OF&nbsp;PORTUGAL.</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    From her Authentic Life, written by a Franciscan friar; Mariana,
    and other Spanish historians. See Janning the Bollandist, Julij,
    t.&nbsp;2, ad diem&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;169.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1336.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Elizabeth was daughter of Peter&nbsp;III. king of
    Arragon, and grand-daughter of James&nbsp;I. who had been educated
    under the care of St.&nbsp;Peter Nolasco, and was surnamed the
    Saint, and from the taking of Majorca and Valentia, Expugnator or
    the Conqueror. Her mother, Constantia, was daughter of Manfred
    king of Sicily, and grandchild to the Emperor Frederic&nbsp;II.
    Our saint was born in 1271, and received at the baptismal font by
    the name of Elizabeth, from her aunt, St.&nbsp;Elizabeth of
    Hungary, who had been canonized by Gregory&nbsp;IX. in 1235. Her
    birth established a good understanding between her grandfather
    James, who was then on the throne, and her father, whose quarrel
    had divided the whole kingdom. The former took upon himself the
    care of her education, inspired her with an ardor for piety above
    her age, though he died in 1276 (having reigned sixty-three
    years), before she had completed the sixth year of her age.</p>
  <p>
    Her father succeeded to the crown, and was careful to place most
    virtuous persons about his daughter, whose example might be to
    her a constant spur to all virtue. The young princess was of a
    most sweet and mild disposition, and from her tender years had no
    relish for anything but what was conducive to piety and devotion.
    It was doing her the most sensible pleasure if any one promised to
    lead her to some chapel to say a prayer. At eight years of age she
    began to fast on vigils, and to practise great self-denials; nor
    could she bear to hear the tenderness of her years and
    constitution alleged as a reason that she ought not to fast or
    macerate her tender body. Her fervor made her eagerly to desire
    that she might have a share in every exercise of virtue which she
    saw practised by others, and she had been already taught that the
    frequent mortification of the senses, and still more of the will,
    is to be joined with prayer to obtain the grace which restrains
    the passions, and prevents their revolt. How little is this most
    important maxim considered by those parents who excite and fortify
    the passions of children, by teaching them a love of vanities, and
    indulging them in gratifications of sense! If rigorous fasts suit
    not their tender age, a submission of the will, perfect obedience,
    and humble modesty, are in no time of life more indispensably to
    be inculcated; nor is any abstinence more necessary than that by
    which children are taught never to drink or eat out of meals, to
    bear several little denials in them without uneasiness, and never
    eagerly to crave anything. The easy and happy victory of Elizabeth
    over herself was owing to this early and perfect temperance,
    submissiveness, and sincere humility. Esteeming virtue her only
    advantage and delight, she abhorred romances and idle
    entertainments, shunned the usual amusements of children, and was
    an enemy to all the vanities of the world. She could bear no other
    songs than sacred hymns and psalms; and from her childhood said
    every day the whole office of the breviary, in which no priest
    could be more scrupulously exact. Her tenderness and compassion
    for the poor made her, even in that tender age, to be styled their
    mother.</p>
  <p>
    At twelve years of age she was given in marriage to Dionysius,
    king of Portugal. That prince had considered in her, birth,
    beauty, riches, and sprightliness of genius, more than virtue; yet
    he allowed her an entire liberty in her devotions, and exceedingly
    esteemed and admired her extraordinary piety. She found no
    temptation to pride in the dazzling splendor of a crown, and could
    say with Esther, that her heart never found any delight in the
    glory, riches, and grandeur with which she was surrounded. She was
    sensible that regularity in our actions is necessary to virtue,
    this being in itself most agreeable to God, who shows in all his
    works how much he is the lover of order; also a prudent
    distribution of time fixes the fickleness of the human mind,
    hinders frequent omissions of pious exercises, and is a means to
    prevent our being ever idle and being governed by humor and
    caprice in what we do, by which motives a disguised self-love
    easily insinuates itself into our ordinary actions. Our saint
    therefore planned for herself a regular distribution of her whole
    time, and of her religious exercises, which she never interrupted,
    unless extraordinary occasions of duty or charity obliged her to
    change the order of her daily practices. She rose very early every
    morning, and after a long morning exercise, and a pious
    meditation, she recited matins, lauds and prime of the Church
    office. Then she heard mass, at which she communicated frequently
    every week. She said every day also the little office of our Lady,
    and that of the dead: and in the afternoon had other regular
    devotions after even-song or vespers. She retired often into her
    oratory to her pious books, and allotted certain hours to attend
    her domestic affairs, public business, or what she owed to others.
    All her spare time she employed in pious reading, or in working
    for the altar, or the poor, and she made her ladies of honor do
    the like. She found no time to spend in vain sports and
    recreations, or in idle discourse or entertainments. She was most
    abstemious in her diet, mean in her attire, humble, meek, and
    affable in conversation, and wholly bent upon the service of God
    in all her actions. Admirable was her spirit of compunction, and
    of holy prayer; and she poured forth her heart before God with
    most feeling sentiments of divine love, and often watered her
    cheeks and the very ground with abundant tears of sweet devotion.
    Frequent attempts were made to prevail with her to moderate her
    austerities, but she always answered that if Christ assures us
    that his spirit cannot find place in a life of softness and
    pleasure, mortification is nowhere more necessary than on the
    throne, where the passions find more dangerous incentives. She
    fasted three days a week, many vigils besides those prescribed by
    the Church; all Advent; a Lent of devotion, from the feast of
    St.&nbsp;John Baptist to the feast of the Assumption; and soon
    after this she began another Lent, which she continued to
    St.&nbsp;Michael’s day. On all Fridays and Saturdays, on the eves
    of all festivals of the Blessed Virgin and the apostles, and on
    many other days, her fast was on bread and water. She often
    visited churches and places of devotion on foot.</p>
  <p>
    Charity to the poor was a distinguishing part of her character.
    She gave constant orders to have all pilgrims and poor strangers
    provided for with lodging and necessaries. She made it her
    business to seek out and secretly relieve persons of good
    condition who were reduced to necessity, yet out of shame durst
    not make known their wants. She was very liberal in furnishing
    fortunes to poor young women, that they might marry according to
    their condition, and not be exposed to the danger of losing their
    virtue. She visited the sick, served them, and dressed and kissed
    their most loathsome sores. She founded in different parts of the
    kingdom many pious establishments, particularly an hospital near
    her own palace at Coïmbra, a house for penitent women who had been
    seduced into evil courses, at Torres-Novas, and an hospital for
    foundlings, or those children who, for want of due provision, are
    exposed to the danger of perishing by poverty, or the neglect and
    cruelty of unnatural parents. She was utterly regardless of her
    own conveniences, and so attentive to the poor and afflicted
    persons of the whole kingdom, that she seemed almost wholly to
    belong to them; not that she neglected any other duties which she
    owed to her neighbor, for she made it her principal study to pay
    to her husband the most dutiful respect, love, and obedience, and
    bore his injuries with invincible meekness and patience. Though
    king Dionysius was a friend of justice, and a valiant, bountiful,
    and compassionate prince, yet he was, in his youth, a worldly man,
    and defiled the sanctity of the nuptial state with abominable
    lusts. The good queen used all her endeavors to reclaim him,
    grieving most sensibly for the offence of God, and the scandal
    given to the people; and she never ceased to weep herself, and to
    procure the prayers of others for his conversion. She strove to
    gain him only by courtesy, and with constant sweetness and
    cheerfulness cherished his natural children, and took great care
    of their education. By these means she softened the heart of the
    king, who, by the succor of a powerful grace, rose out of the
    filthy puddle in which he had wallowed for a long time, and kept
    ever after the fidelity that was due to his virtuous consort. He
    instituted the order of Christ in 1318; founded, with a truly
    royal magnificence, the university of Coïmbra, and adorned his
    kingdom with public buildings. His extraordinary virtues,
    particularly his liberality, justice, and constancy, are highly
    extolled by the Portuguese, and after his entire conversion, he
    was the idol and glory of his people. A&nbsp;little time before
    his perfect conversion there happened an extraordinary accident.
    The queen had a very pious, faithful page, whom she employed in
    the distribution of her secret alms. A&nbsp;wicked fellow-page
    envying him on account of this favor, to which his virtue and
    services entitled him, treacherously suggested to his majesty that
    the queen showed a fondness for that page. The prince, who by his
    own sensual heart was easily inclined to judge ill of others, gave
    credit to the slander, and resolved to take away the life of the
    innocent youth. For this purpose he gave order to a lime-burner,
    that if on such a day he sent to him a page with this errand to
    inquire, “Whether he had fulfilled the king’s commands?” he should
    take him and cast him into the lime-kiln, there to be burnt; for
    that death he had justly incurred, and the execution was expedient
    for the king’s service. On the day appointed he despatched the
    page with this message to the lime-kiln; but the devout youth on
    the road passing by a church, heard the bell ring at the elevation
    at mass, went in and prayed there devoutly; for it was his pious
    custom, if he ever heard the sign given by the bell for the
    elevation, always to go thither, and not depart till mass was
    ended. It happened, on that occasion, that as the first was not a
    whole mass, and it was with him a constant rule to hear mass every
    day, he stayed in the church, and heard successively two other
    masses. In the meantime, the king, who was impatient to know if
    his orders had been executed, sent the informer to the lime-kiln,
    to inquire whether his commands had been obeyed; but as soon as he
    was come to the kiln, and had asked the question, the man,
    supposing him to be the messenger meant by the king’s order,
    seized him, and threw him into the burning lime, where he was soon
    consumed. Thus was the innocent protected by his devotion, and the
    slanderer was overtaken by divine justice. The page who had heard
    the masses went afterward to the lime-kiln, and having asked
    whether his majesty’s commands had been yet executed, brought him
    back word that they were. The king was almost out of himself with
    surprise when he saw him come back with this message, and being
    soon informed of the particulars, he easily discovered the
    innocence of the pious youth, adored the divine judgments, and
    ever after respected the great virtue and sanctity of his
    queen.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Elizabeth had by the king two children, Alphonsus, who
    afterward succeeded his father, and Constantia, who was married to
    Ferdinand&nbsp;IV., king of Castille. This son, when grown up,
    married the infanta of Castille, and soon after revolting against
    his own father, put himself at the head of an army of
    malecontents. St.&nbsp;Elizabeth had recourse to weeping, prayer,
    fasting, and almsdeeds, and exhorted her son in the strongest
    terms to return to his duty, conjuring her husband at the same
    time to forgive him. Pope John&nbsp;XXII. wrote to her, commending
    her religious and prudent conduct; but certain court flatterers
    whispering to the king that she was suspected of favoring her son,
    he, whom jealousy made credulous, banished her to the city of
    Alanquer. The queen received this disgrace with admirable patience
    and peace of mind, and made use of the opportunity which her
    retirement afforded, to redouble her austerities and devotions.
    She never would entertain any correspondence with the
    malecontents, nor listen to any suggestions from them. The king
    himself admired her goodness, meekness, and humility under her
    disgrace; and shortly after called her back to court, and showed
    her greater love and respect than ever. In all her troubles she
    committed herself to the sweet disposal of divine providence,
    considering that she was always under the protection of God, her
    merciful father.</p>
  <p>
    Being herself of the most sweet and peaceable disposition, she was
    always most active and industrious in composing all differences
    between neighbors, especially in averting war, with the train of
    all the most terrible evils which attend it. She reconciled her
    husband and son, when their armies were marching one against the
    other; and she reduced all the subjects to duty and obedience. She
    made peace between Ferdinand&nbsp;IV., king of Castille, and
    Alphonsus de la Cerda, his cousin-german, who disputed the crown:
    likewise between James&nbsp;II., king of Arragon, her own brother,
    and Ferdinand&nbsp;IV., the king of Castille, her son-in-law. In
    order to effect this last she took a journey with her husband into
    both those kingdoms, and to the great satisfaction of the
    Christian world, put a happy period to all dissensions and debates
    between those states. After this charitable work, king Dionysius,
    having reigned forty-five years, fell sick. St.&nbsp;Elizabeth
    gave him most signal testimonies of her love and affection, scarce
    ever leaving his chamber during his illness, unless to go to the
    church, and taking infinite pains to serve and attend him. But her
    main care and solicitude was to secure his eternal happiness, and
    to procure that he might depart this life in sentiments of perfect
    repentance and piety. For this purpose she gave bountiful alms,
    and caused many prayers and masses to be said. During his long and
    tedious illness he gave great marks of sincere compunction, and
    died at Santaren, on the 6th of January, 1325. As soon as he had
    expired, the queen retired into her oratory, commended his soul to
    God, and consecrating herself to the divine service, put on the
    habit of the third Order of Saint Francis. She attended the
    funeral procession, with her husband’s corpse, to Odiveras, where
    he had chosen his burying-place in a famous church of Cistercian
    monks. After a considerable stay there, she made a pilgrimage to
    Compostella, and returning to Odiveras, celebrated there her
    husband’s anniversary with great solemnity; after which she
    retired to a convent of Clares, which she had begun to rebuild
    before the death of her husband. She was desirous to make her
    religious profession, but was diverted from that design for some
    time upon a motive of charity, that she might continue to support
    an infinity of poor people by her alms and protection. She
    therefore contented herself at first with wearing the habit of the
    third Order, living in a house which she built contiguous to her
    great nunnery, in which she assembled ninety devout nuns. She
    often visited them, and sometimes served them at table, having for
    her companion in this practice of charity and humility her
    daughter-in-law, Beatrix, the queen then reigning.<a id="c8_1a">
    </a>However, by authentic historical proofs it is evinced that
    before her death she made her religious profession in the
    aforesaid third Order, as pope Urban&nbsp;VIII., after mature
    discussion of those monuments, has declared.<a
      href="#fn_67"

  <p>
    A&nbsp;war being lighted up between her son Alphonsus&nbsp;IV.,
    surnamed the brave, king of Portugal, and her grandson,
    Alphonsus&nbsp;XI., king of Castille, and armies being set on
    foot, she was startled at the news, and resolved to set out to
    reconcile them, and extinguish the fire that was kindling. Her
    servants endeavored to persuade her to defer her journey, on
    account of the excessive heats, but she made answer that she could
    not better expend her health and her life than by seeking to
    prevent the miseries and calamities of a war. The very news of her
    journey disposed both parties to peace. She went to Estremoz, upon
    the frontiers of Portugal and Castille, where her son was; but she
    arrived ill of a violent fever, which she looked upon as a
    messenger sent by God to warn her that the time was at hand
    wherein he called her to himself. She strongly exhorted her son to
    the love of peace and to a holy life; she confessed several times,
    received the holy viaticum on her knees at the foot of the altar,
    and shortly after extreme unction; from which time she continued
    in fervent prayer, often invoking the Blessed Virgin, and
    repeating these words: “Mary, mother of grace, mother of mercy,
    defend us from the wicked enemy, and receive us at the hour of our
    death.” She appeared overflowing with heavenly joy, and with those
    consolations of the Holy Ghost which make death so sweet to the
    saints; and in the presence of her son, the king, and of her
    daughter-in-law, she gave up her happy soul to God on the 4th of
    July, in the year 1336, of her age sixty-five. She was buried with
    royal pomp in the church of her monastery of poor Clares, at
    Coïmbra, and honored by miracles. Leo&nbsp;X. and Paul&nbsp;IV.
    granted an office on her festival; and in 1612 her body was taken
    up and found entire. It is now richly enshrined in a magnificent
    chapel, built on purpose. She was canonized by Urban&nbsp;VIII. in
    1625, and the 8th of July appointed for her festival.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    The characteristical virtue of St.&nbsp;Elizabeth was a love of
    peace. Christ, the prince of peace, declares his spirit to be the
    spirit of humility and meekness; consequently the spirit of peace.
    Variance, wrath, and strife, are the works of the flesh, of envy,
    and pride, which he condemns, and which exclude from the kingdom
    of heaven. Bitterness and contention shut out reason, make the
    soul deaf to the motives of religion, and open the understanding
    to nothing but what is sinful. To find the way of peace we must be
    meek and patient, even under the most violent provocations; we
    must never resent any wrong, nor return railing for railing, but
    good for evil; we must regard passion as the worst of monsters,
    and must judge it as unreasonable to hearken to its suggestions as
    to choose a madman for our counsellor in matters of concern and
    difficulty; above all, we must abhor it not only as a sin, but as
    leading to a numberless variety of other grievous sins and
    spiritual evils. <i>Blessed are the peacemakers</i>, and all who
    love and cultivate this virtue among men, <i>they shall be called
    the children of God</i>, whose badge and image they bear.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;PROCOPIUS,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Jerusalem, but lived at Bethsan, otherwise
    called Scythopolis, where he was reader in the church, and also
    performed the function of exorcist, and dispossessing demoniacs,
    and that of interpreter of the Greek tongue into the
    Syro-Chaldaic.<a
      href="#fn_68"
      class="anchor">68</a>
    He was a divine man, say his acts, and had always lived in the
    practice of great austerity and patience, and in perpetual
    chastity. He took no other sustenance than bread and water, and
    usually abstained from all food for two or three days together. He
    was well skilled in the science of the Greeks, but much more in
    that of the holy scriptures; the assiduous meditation on which
    nourished his soul, and seemed also to give vigor and strength to
    his emaciated body. He was admirable in all virtues, particularly
    in a heavenly meekness and humility. Dioclesian’s bloody edicts
    against the Christians reached Palestine in April, 303, and
    Procopius was the first person who received the crown of martyrdom
    in that country, in the aforesaid persecution.<a id="c8_2a">
    </a>He was apprehended at Bethsan and led, with several others,
    bound to Cæsarea, our city, say the acts, and was hurried straight
    before Paulinus, prefect of the province.<a
      href="#fn_69"
      class="anchor">69</a>
    The judge commanded the martyr to sacrifice to the gods. The
    servant of Christ answered he never could do it; and this he
    declared with a firmness and resolution that seemed to wound the
    heart of the prefect as if it had been pierced with a dagger. The
    martyr added, there is no God but one, who is the author and
    preserver of the world. The prefect then bade him sacrifice to the
    four emperors, namely Dioclesian, Herculius, Galerius, and
    Constantius. This the saint again refused to do, and had scarce
    returned his answer but the judge passed sentence upon him, and he
    was immediately led to execution and beheaded. He is honored by
    the Greeks with the title of The Great Martyr. See his original
    Chaldaic Acts, published by Steph. Assemani, t.&nbsp;2,
    p.&nbsp;166, and a less accurate old Latin translation; given by
    Ruinart, and by Henry Valois, Not. in Euseb. l.&nbsp;8. The author

    SS.&nbsp;KILIAN BISHOP, COLMAN&nbsp;PRIEST, AND
    TOTNAN&nbsp;DEACON,&nbsp;MM.</h3>
  <p>
    Kilian or Kuln was a holy Irish monk, of noble Scottish
    extraction. With two zealous companions he travelled to Rome in
    686, and obtained of pope Conon a commission to preach the gospel
    to the German idolaters in Franconia; upon which occasion Kilian
    was invested with episcopal authority. The missionaries converted
    and baptized great numbers at Wurtzburg, and among others Gosbert,
    the duke of that name. This prince had taken to wife Geilana, the
    relict of his deceased brother; and though he loved her tenderly,
    being put in mind by St.&nbsp;Kilian that such a marriage was
    condemned and void by the law of the gospel, he promised to
    dismiss her, saying that we are bound to love God above father,
    mother, or wife. Geilana was tormented in mind beyond measure at
    this resolution; jealousy and ambition equally inflamed her
    breast; and, as the vengeance of a wicked woman has no bounds,
    during the absence of the duke in a military expedition, she sent
    assassins, who privately murdered the three holy missionaries in
    688. The ruffians were themselves pursued by divine vengeance, and
    all perished miserably. St.&nbsp;Burchard, who, in the following
    century, was placed by St.&nbsp;Boniface in the episcopal see of
    Wurtzburg, translated their relics into his cathedral.
    A&nbsp;portion of those of St.&nbsp;Kilian, in a rich shrine, was
    preserved in the treasury of the elector of Brunswic-Lunenburg in
    1713, as appears from the printed description of that cabinet. See
    the acts of these martyrs compiled by Egilward, monk of
    St.&nbsp;Burchard’s at Wurtzburg, extant imperfect in the eleventh
    century, in Surius, t.&nbsp;4, entire in Canisius, t.&nbsp;4,

    ST.&nbsp;WITHBURGE,&nbsp;V.</h3>
  <p>
    She was the youngest of the four sisters, all saints, daughters of
    Annas the holy king of the East-Angles. In her tender years she
    devoted herself to the divine service, and led an austere life in
    close solitude for several years at Holkham, an estate of the king
    her father, near the sea-coast in Norfolk, where a church,
    afterward called Withburgstow, was built. After the death of her
    father she changed her dwelling to another estate of the crown
    called Dereham. This is at present a considerable market-town in
    Norfolk, but was then an obscure retired place. Withburge
    assembled there many devout virgins, and laid the foundation of a
    great church and nunnery, but did not live to finish the
    buildings. Her holy death happened on the 17th of March, 743. Her
    body was interred in the church-yard of Dereham, and fifty-five
    years after, found uncorrupt, and translated into the church. One
    hundred and seventy-six years after this, in 974, Brithnoth (the
    first abbot of Ely, after that house, which had been destroyed by
    the Danes, was rebuilt), with the consent of king Edgar, removed
    it to Ely, and deposited it near the bodies of her two sisters. In
    1106 the remains of the four saints were translated into the new
    church and laid near the high altar. The bodies of
    SS.&nbsp;Sexburga and Ermenilda were reduced to dust, except the
    bones. That of St.&nbsp;Audry was entire, and that of
    St.&nbsp;Withburge was not only sound but also fresh, and the
    limbs perfectly flexible. Warner, a monk of Westminster, showed
    this to all the people, by lifting up and moving several ways the
    hands, arms, and feet. Herbert bishop of Thetford, who in 1094
    translated his see to Norwich, and many other persons of
    distinction, were eye-witnesses hereof.<a id="c8_4a"> </a>This is
    related by Thomas, monk of Ely, in his history of Ely,<a

    B.&nbsp;THEOBALD, ABBOT.</h3>
  <p>
    He was by his virtue the great ornament of the illustrious family
    of Montmorency in France. He was born in the castle of Marli. His
    father, Bouchard of Montmorency, gave him an education suitable to
    his birth, and trained him up to the profession of arms, in which
    so many heroes of that family have signalized themselves. But
    Theobald manifested from his infancy a strong inclination to a
    state of holy retirement, dreading the least shadow of danger
    which could threaten his innocence. He spent great part of his
    time in prayer, and resorted often to the church of the nunnery
    called Port-Royal, which had been founded in 1204 by Matthew of
    Montmorency, and on which his father Bouchard had bestowed so many
    estates that he was regarded as a second founder. Theobald took
    the Cistercian habit at Vaux de Cernay in 1220, and was chosen
    abbot of that house in 1234. He lived in the midst of his brethren
    as the servant of every one, and surpassed all others in his love
    of poverty, silence, and holy prayer. He was highly esteemed by
    St.&nbsp;Lewis. His happy death happened in 1247. His shrine in
    his abbey is visited by a great concourse of people on the
    Whitsun-holidays. His solemn festival is there kept on the 8th,

    SAINT GRIMBALD, NATIVE OF ST.&nbsp;OMER,&nbsp;ABBOT.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a monk at St.&nbsp;Bertin’s, and with his abbot entertained
    king Alfred in that abbey when that prince was going to Rome. This
    king, afterward by the advice of Eldred archbishop of Canterbury,
    sent messengers to St.&nbsp;Bertin’s to invite Grimbald over into
    England, where he arrived, Hugh being twelfth abbot of that
    monastery, in the year 885. Asserius, a monk of Menevia or
    St.&nbsp;David’s, whom king Alfred honored with his particular
    esteem, and who was afterward bishop of Shireburn, was one of
    these messengers.</p>
  <p>
    The Oxonian writers tell us that Grimbald was appointed first
    professor of divinity at Oxford, when he is said to have founded
    that university; and that Asserius, John Erigena, and
    St.&nbsp;Neot taught there at the same time. The learned
    Mr.&nbsp;Hearne says not only that Grimbald built St.&nbsp;Peter’s
    church in the East, but also that the eastern vault of his ancient
    structure is standing to this day, of which he gives a plan. Upon
    the death of Eldred archbishop of Canterbury, king Alfred pressed
    Grimbald to accept that dignity; but was not able to extort his
    consent, and was obliged to allow him to retire to the church of
    Winchester. King Alfred’s son and successor Edward, in compliance
    with his father’s will, built the New Minstre close to the old, in
    which he placed secular canons, says Tanner, and appointed
    St.&nbsp;Grimbald abbot over them; this title being then given to
    a superior of secular or regular priests. About sixty years after,
    bishop Ethelwolph brought in monks in place of those secular
    canons. King Henry&nbsp;I. removed this monastery of New Minstre
    out of the walls of the city to the place called Hide, which still
    continued sometimes to be called St.&nbsp;Grimbald’s monastery.
    The body of the great king Alfred was removed by his son from the
    Old Minstre, and that of his queen Alswithe from the nunnery of
    Nunnaminstre, and deposited together in the New Minstre, afterward
    in Hide-Monastery. Nunnaminstre was founded by king Alfred, or
    rather by his queen Alswithe. St.&nbsp;Edburge, a daughter of king
    Edward, was a nun, and, according to Leland, abbess there.
    St.&nbsp;Grimbald in his last sickness, though extremely feeble,
    gathered strength when the sacred viaticum was brought, rose out
    of bed, and received it prostrate on the ground. After this he
    desired to be left alone for three days, which he spent in close
    union of his heart with God. On the fourth day the community was
    called into his chamber, and amidst their prayers the saint calmly
    breathed forth his happy soul on the 8th of July in the year 903,
    of his age eighty-three. His body was reposed in this church, and
    honored amongst its most precious relics. It was taken up by
    St.&nbsp;Elphegus, and exposed in a silver shrine. See his life

    the banks of the Tigris, in Mesopotamia. His parents lived in the
    country, and earned their bread with the sweat of their brows, but
    were ennobled by the blood of martyrs in their family, and had
    themselves both confessed Christ before the persecutors under
    Dioclesian, or his successors. They consecrated Ephrem to God from
    his cradle, like another Samuel, but he was eighteen years old
    when he was baptized.<a id="c9_1a"> </a>Before that time he had
    committed certain faults which his enlightened conscience
    extremely exaggerated to him after his perfect conversion to God,
    and he never ceased to bewail, with floods of tears, his
    ingratitude towards God, in having ever offended him. Sozomen<a
      href="#fn_72"
      class="anchor">72</a>
    says these sins were little sallies of anger, into which he had
    sometimes fallen with his playfellows in his childhood.<a
    id="c9_1b"> </a>The saint himself mentions in his confession<a
      href="#fn_73"
      class="anchor">73</a>
    two crimes (as he styles them) of this age, which called for his
    tears during his whole life. The first was, that in play he had
    driven a neighbor’s cow among the mountains, where it happened to
    be killed by a wild beast; the second was a doubt which once came
    into his mind in his childhood, whether God’s particular
    providence reached to an immediate superintendency over all our
    individual actions. This sin he exceedingly magnifies in his
    contrition, though it happened before his baptism, and never
    proceeded further than a fluctuating thought from ignorance in
    his childhood; and in his Testament he thanks God for having been
    always preserved by his mercy since his baptism from any error in
    faith. Himself assures us that the divine goodness was pleased in
    a wonderful manner to discover to him, after this temptation, the
    folly of his error, and the wretched blindness of his soul in
    having pretended to fathom the secrets of providence.</p>
  <p>
    Within a month after he had been assaulted by the temptation of
    the aforesaid doubt, he happened in travelling through the country
    to be benighted, and was forced to take up his quarters with a
    shepherd who had lost in the wilderness the flock committed to his
    charge. The master of the shepherd suspected him guilty of theft,
    and pursuing him, found him and Ephrem together, and cast them
    both into prison, upon suspicion that they had stolen his sheep.
    Ephrem was extremely afflicted at his misfortune, and in the
    dungeon found seven other prisoners, who were all falsely accused
    or suspected of different crimes, though really guilty of others.
    When he had lain seven days in prison in great anguish of mind, an
    angel appearing to him in his sleep told him he was sent to show
    him the justice and wisdom of divine providence in governing and
    directing all human events; and that this should be manifested to
    him in the case of those prisoners who seemed to suffer in his
    company unjustly. The next day the judge called the prisoners
    before him, and put two of them to the torture, in order to compel
    them to confess their crimes. While others were tormented, Ephrem
    stood by the rack trembling and weeping for himself, under the
    apprehension of being every moment put to the question. The
    bystanders rallied him for his fears, and said—“Ay, it is thy turn
    next; it is to no purpose now to weep: why didst thou not fear to
    commit the crime?” However, he was not put on the rack, but sent
    back to prison. The other prisoners, though innocent of the crimes
    of which they were first arraigned, were all convicted of other
    misdemeanors, and each of them received the chastisement due to
    his offence. As to Ephrem, the true thief having been discovered,
    he was honorably acquitted, after seventy days’ confinement.<a
    id="c9_1c"> </a>This event the saint relates at length in his
    confession.<a
      href="#fn_74"
      class="anchor">74</a>
    God was pleased to give him this sensible proof of the sweetness,
    justice, and tender goodness of his holy providence, which we are
    bound to adore in resignation and silence; waiting until the
    curtain shall be drawn aside, and the whole economy of his loving
    dispensations to his elect displayed in its true amiable light,
    and placed in its full view before our eyes in the next life.
    Though, to take a view of the infinite wisdom, justice, and
    sanctity which God displayeth in all the dispensations of his
    providence, we must take into the prospect the rewards and
    punishments of the next world, and all the hidden springs of this
    adorable mystery of faith; yet his divine goodness to excite our
    confidence in him, was pleased, by this revelation to his servant,
    to manifest in this instance his attributes justified in part,
    even in this life, of which he hath given us a most illustrious
    example with regard to holy Job.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem, from the time of his baptism, which he received
    soon after this accident, began to be more deeply penetrated with
    the fear of the divine judgment, and he had always present to his
    mind the rigorous account he was to give to God of all his
    actions, the remembrance of which was to him a source of almost
    uninterrupted tears. Hoping more easily to secure his salvation in
    a state in which his thoughts would never be diverted from it,
    soon after he was baptized he took the monastic habit, and put
    himself under the direction of a holy abbot, with whose leave he
    chose for his abode a little hermitage in the neighborhood of the
    monastery. He seemed to set no bounds to his fervor. He lay on the
    bare ground, often fasted whole days without eating, and watched a
    great part of the night in prayer. It was a rule observed in all
    the monasteries of Mesopotamia and Egypt, that every religious man
    should perform his task of manual labor, of which he gave an
    account to his superior at the end of every week. The work of
    these monks was always painful, that it might be a part of their
    penance; and it was such as was compatible with private prayer,
    and a constant attention of the mind to God; for they always
    prayed or meditated at their work; and for this purpose, the first
    task which was enjoined a young monk was to get the psalter by
    heart. The profits of their labor, above the little pittance which
    was necessary for their mean subsistence in their penitential
    state, were always given to the poor. St.&nbsp;Ephrem made sails
    for ships. Of his poverty he writes thus in his Testament: “Ephrem
    hath never possessed purse, staff, or scrip, or any other temporal
    estate; my heart hath known no affection for gold or silver, or
    any earthly goods.” He was naturally choleric, but so perfectly
    did he subdue this passion, that meekness was one of the most
    conspicuous virtues in his character, and he was usually styled
    <i>The meek</i>, or <i>the peaceable man of God</i>. He was never
    known to dispute or contend with any one; with the most obstinate
    sinners he used only tears and entreaties. Once, when he had
    fasted several days, the brother who was bringing him a mess of
    pottage made with a few herbs for his meal, let fall the pot, and
    broke it. The saint seeing him in confusion, said cheerfully,—“As
    our supper will not come to us, let us go to it.” And sitting down
    on the ground by the broken pot, he picked up his meal as well as
    he could. Humility made the saint rejoice in the contempt of
    himself, and sincerely desire that all men had such a knowledge
    and opinion of his baseness and nothingness as to despise him from
    their hearts, and to look upon him most unworthy to hold any rank
    among creatures. This sincere spirit of profound humility all his
    words, actions, and writings breathed in a most affecting
    manner.</p>
  <p>
    Honors and commendations served to increase the saint’s humility.
    Hearing himself one day praised, he was not able to speak, and his
    whole body was covered with a violent sweat, caused by the inward
    agony and confusion of his soul at the consideration of the last
    day; for he was seized with extreme fear and dread, thinking that
    he should be then overwhelmed with shame, when his baseness and
    hypocrisy should be proclaimed and made manifest before all
    creatures, especially those very persons who here commended him,
    and whom he had deceived by his hypocrisy. We may hence easily
    judge how much the thought of any elevation or honor affrighted
    him. When a certain city sought to choose him bishop, he
    counterfeited himself mad.</p>
  <p>
    Compunction of heart is the sister of sincere humility and
    penance, and nothing seemed more admirable in our saint than this
    virtue. Tears seemed always ready to be called forth in torrents
    as often as he raised his heart to God, or remembered the
    sweetness of his divine love, the rigor of his judgments, or the
    spiritual miseries of our souls. “We cannot call to mind his
    perpetual tears,” says St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, “without melting
    into tears. To weep seemed almost as natural to him as it is for
    other men to breathe. Night and day his eyes seemed always
    swimming in tears. No one could meet him at any time, who did not
    see them trickling down his cheeks.” He appeared always drowned in
    an abyss of compunction. This was always painted in most striking
    features on his countenance, the sight of which was, even in his
    silence, a moving instruction to all that beheld him. This spirit
    of compunction gave a singular energy to all his words and
    writings; it never forsakes him, even in panegyrics or in treating
    of subjects of spiritual joy. Where he speaks of the felicity of
    paradise or the sweetness of divine love in transports of
    overflowing hope and joy, he never lost sight of the motives of
    compunction, and always returns to his tears. By the continual
    remembrance of the last judgment he nourished in his soul this
    constant profound spirit of compunction.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa writes, that no one can read his
    discourses on the last judgment without dissolving into tears, so
    awful is the representation, and so strong and lively the image
    which he paints of that dreadful day. Almost every object he saw
    called it afresh to his mind. The spotless purity of our saint was
    the fruit of his sincere humility, and constant watchfulness over
    himself. He says that the great St.&nbsp;Antony, out of modesty,
    would never wash his feet, or suffer any part of his body, except
    his face and hands, to be seen naked by any one.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem spent many years in the desert, collected within
    himself, having his mind raised above all earthly things, and
    living as it were out of the flesh, and out of the world, to use
    the expression of St.&nbsp;Gregory Nazianzen. His zeal drew
    several severe persecutions upon him from certain tepid monks,
    but he found a great support in the example and advice of
    St.&nbsp;Julian, whose life he has written. He lost this comfort
    by the death of that great servant of God; and about the same time
    died in 338 (not 350, as Tillemont mistakes), St.&nbsp;James,
    bishop of Nisibis, his spiritual director and patron. Not long
    after this, God inspired St.&nbsp;Ephrem to leave his own country,
    and go to Edessa, there to venerate the relics of the saints, by
    which are probably meant chiefly those of the apostle
    St.&nbsp;Thomas. He likewise desired to enjoy the conversation of
    certain holy anchorets who inhabited the mountains near that city,
    which was sometimes reckoned in Mesopotamia and sometimes in
    Syria. Under the weak reigns of the last of the Seleucidæ, kings
    of Asia, it was erected into a small kingdom by the princes called
    Abgars. As the saint was going into Edessa, a certain courtezan
    fixed her eyes upon him, which when he perceived he turned away
    his face, and said with indignation: “Why dost thou gaze upon me?”
    To which she made this smart reply. “Woman was formed from man;
    but you ought always to keep your eyes cast down on the earth, out
    of which man was framed.” St.&nbsp;Ephrem, whose heart was always
    filled with the most profound sentiments of humility, was much
    struck and pleased with this reflection, and admired the
    providence of God, which sends us admonitions by all sorts of
    means. He wrote a book on those words of the courtezan, which the
    Syrians anciently esteemed the most useful and the best of all the
    writings of this incomparable doctor, but it is now lost. It seems
    to have contained maxims of humility.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem lived at Edessa, highly honored by all ranks and
    orders of men. Being ordained deacon of that church, he became an
    apostle of penance, which he preached with incredible zeal and
    fruit. He from time to time returned into his desert, there to
    renew in his heart the spirit of compunction and prayer; but
    always came out of his wilderness, inflamed with the ardor of a
    Baptist, to announce the divine truths to a world buried in
    spiritual darkness and insensibility. The saint was educated with
    great natural talents, which he had improved by study and
    contemplation. He was a poet, and had read something of logic; but
    had no tincture of the rest of the Grecian philosophy. This want
    of the heathenish learning and profane science was supplied by his
    good sense and uncommon penetration, and the diligence with which
    he cultivated his faculties by more sublime sacred studies. He
    learned very accurately the doctrine of the Catholic faith, was
    well versed in the holy scriptures, and was a perfect master of
    the Syriac tongue, in which he wrote with great elegance and
    propriety. He was possessed of an extraordinary faculty of natural
    eloquence. Words flowed from him like a torrent, which yet were
    too slow for the impetuosity and multitude of thoughts with which
    he was overwhelmed in speaking on spiritual subjects. His
    conceptions were always clear, his diction pure and agreeable. He
    spoke with admirable perspicuity, copiousness, and
    sententiousness, in an easy unaffected style; and with so much
    sweetness, so pathetic a vehemence, so natural an accent, and so
    strong emotions of his own heart, that his words seemed to carry
    with them an irresistible power. His writings derive great
    strength from the genius and natural bold tropes of the Oriental
    languages applied by so great a master, and have a graceful beauty
    and force which no translation can attain; though his works are
    only impetuous effusions of an overflowing heart, not studied
    compositions. What recommends them beyond all other advantages of
    eloquence, is, they are all the language of the heart, and a heart
    penetrated with the most perfect sentiments of divine love,
    confidence, compunction, humility, and all other virtues. They
    present his ardent, humble, and meek soul such as it was, and
    show how ardently he was occupied only on the great truths of
    salvation; how much he humbled himself without intermission, under
    the almighty hand of God, infinite in sanctity and terrible in his
    justice; with what profound awe he trembled in the constant
    attention to his adorable presence, and at the remembrance of his
    dreadful judgment, and with what fervor he both preached and
    practised the most austere penance, laboring continually with all
    his strength “to prepare himself a treasure for the last hour,” as
    he expresses himself. His words strongly imprint upon the souls of
    others those sentiments with which he was penetrated: they carry
    light and conviction; they never fail to strike, and pierce to the
    very bottom of the soul.<a id="c9_1d"> </a>Nor is the fire which
    they kindle in the breast a passing warmth, but a flame which
    devours and destroys all earthly affections, transforms the soul
    into itself, and continues without abating, the lasting force of
    its activity.<a
      href="#fn_75"
      class="anchor">75</a>
    “Who that is proud,” says St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, “would not
    become the humblest of men by reading his discourse on humility?
    Who would not be inflamed with a divine fire by reading his
    treatise on charity? Who would not wish to be chaste in heart and
    spirit, by reading the praises he has given to virginity?”</p>
  <p id="c9_1e">
    The saint, though most austere to himself, was discreet in the
    direction of others, and often repeated this advice, that it is a
    dangerous stratagem of the enemy to induce fervent converts to
    embrace in the beginning excessive mortifications.<a
      href="#fn_76"
      class="anchor">76</a>
    Wherefore it behooves them not to undertake without prudent
    counsel any extraordinary practices of penance; but always such
    in which they will be able to persevere with constancy and
    cheerfulness. Who ever laid on a child a burden of a hundred
    pounds weight, under which he is sure to fall?</p>
  <p>
    St. Ephrem brought many idolaters to the faith, and converted
    great numbers of Arians, Sabellians, and other heretics. Saint
    Jerom commends a book which he wrote against the Macedonians, to
    prove the divinity of the Holy Ghost. He established the perfect
    efficacy of penance against the Novatians, who, though the boldest
    and most insolent of men, seemed like children without strength
    before this experienced champion, as St. Gregory of Nyssa assures
    us. Not less glorious were his triumphs over the Millenarians,
    Marcionites, Manichees, and the disciples of the impious
    Bardesanes, who denied the resurrection of the flesh, and had in
    the foregoing century spread his errors at Edessa, by songs which
    the people learned to sing. St. Ephrem, to minister a proper
    antidote against this poison, composed elegant Catholic songs and
    poems which he taught the inhabitants both of the city and country
    with great spiritual advantage. Apollinaris began openly to broach
    his heresy a little before the year 376, denying in Christ a human
    soul, which he pretended that the divine person supplied in the
    humanity: whence it would have followed that he was not truly man,
    but only assumed a human body, not the complete human nature. St.
    Ephrem was then very old, but he opposed this new monster with
    great vigor. Several heresies he crushed in their birth, and he
    suffered much from the fury of the Arians under Constantius, and
    of the Heathens under Julian, but in both these persecutions
    reaped glorious laurels and trophies.</p>
  <p id="c9_1f">
    It was by a divine admonition, as himself assures us,<a
      href="#fn_77"
      class="anchor">77</a>
    that about the year 372, he undertook a long journey to pay a
    visit to Basil. Being arrived at Cæsarea he went to the great
    church, where he found the holy bishop preaching.<a id="c9_1g">
    </a>After the sermon, St.&nbsp;Basil sent for him, and asked him
    by an interpreter, if he was not Ephrem the servant of Christ.<a
      href="#fn_78"
      class="anchor">78</a>
    “I&nbsp;am that Ephrem,” said he, “who have wandered astray from
    the path of heaven.” Then melting into tears, and raising his
    voice, he cried out,—“O&nbsp;my father, have pity on a sinful
    wretch, and lead me into the narrow path.” St.&nbsp;Basil gave him
    many rules of holy life, and after long spiritual conferences
    dismissed him with great esteem, having first ordained his
    companion priest.<a id="c9_1h"> </a>St.&nbsp;Ephrem himself never
    would consent to be promoted to the sacerdotal dignity, of which
    he expresses the greatest dread and apprehension, in his sermon on
    the priesthood.<a
      href="#fn_79"
      class="anchor">79</a>
    Being returned to Edessa he retired to a little solitary cell,
    where he prepared himself for his last passage, and composed the
    latter part of his works. For, not content to labor for the
    advantage of one age, or one people, he studied to promote that of
    all mankind, and all times to come. The public distress under a
    great famine called him again out of his retirement in order to
    serve, and procure relief for the poor. He engaged the rich freely
    to open their coffers, placed beds for the sick in all the public
    porticos, visited them every day, and served them with his own
    hands. The public calamity being over, he hastened back to his
    solitude, where he shortly after sickened of a fever. He wrote
    about that time his seventy-six Paræneses or moving exhortations
    to penance, consisting in a great measure of most effective
    prayers; several of which are used by the Syrians in their Church
    office. His confidence in the precious fruits of the holy
    sacrament of the altar raised his hope, and inflamed his love,
    especially in his passage to eternity.<a id="c9_1i"> </a>Thus he
    expresses himself:<a
      href="#fn_80"
      class="anchor">80</a>
    “Entering upon so long and dangerous a journey I&nbsp;have my
    viaticum, even Thee, O&nbsp;Son of God. In my extreme spiritual
    hunger, I&nbsp;will feed on thee, the repairer of mankind. So it
    shall be that no fire will dare to approach me; for it will not be
    able to bear the sweet saving odor of thy body and blood.” The
    circumstances of our saint’s death are edifying and deserve our
    notice. For nothing more strongly affects our heart, or makes on
    it a more sensible impression, than the behavior and words of
    great men in their last moments.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem was always filled with grief, indignation, and
    confusion when he perceived others to treat him as a saint, or to
    express any regard or esteem for him.<a id="c9_1j"> </a>In his
    last sickness he laid this strict injunction on his disciples and
    friends:<a
      href="#fn_81"
      class="anchor">81</a>
    “Sing no funeral hymns at Ephrem’s burial: suffer no encomiastic
    oration. Wrap not my carcase in any costly shroud: erect no
    monument to my memory. Allow me only the portion and place of a
    pilgrim; for I&nbsp;am a pilgrim and a stranger as all my fathers
    were on earth.” Seeing that several persons had prepared rich
    shrouds for his interment, he was much afflicted, and he charged
    all those who had such a design to drop it, and give the money to
    the poor, which he in particular obliged a rich nobleman, who had
    bought a most sumptuous shroud for that purpose, to do.
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem, as long as he was able to speak, continued to
    exhort all men to the fervent pursuit of virtue, as his last words
    sufficiently show, says St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, meaning the
    saint’s Testament, which is still extant genuine, and the same
    that was quoted by St.&nbsp;Gregory, Sozomen, &amp;c. In it he
    says:<a id="c9_1k"> </a>“I&nbsp;Ephrem die. Be it known to you all
    that I&nbsp;write this Testament to conjure you always to remember
    me in your prayers after my decease.”<a
      href="#fn_82"
      class="anchor">82</a>
    This he often repeats. He protests that he had always lived in the
    true faith, to which he exhorts all most firmly to adhere.
    Deploring and confessing aloud the vanity and sinfulness of his
    life, he adjures all present that no one would suffer his sinful
    dust to be laid under the altar, and that no one would take any of
    his rags for relics, nor show him any honor, for he was a sinner
    and the last of creatures. “But,” says he, “throw my body hastily
    on your shoulders, and cast me into my grave, as the abomination
    of the universe. Let no one praise me; for I&nbsp;am full of
    confusion, and the very abstract of baseness. To show what
    I&nbsp;am, rather spit upon me, and cover my body with phlegm. Did
    you smell the stench of my actions, you would fly from me, and
    leave me unburied, not being able to bear the horrible corruption
    of my sins.” He forbids any torches or perfumes, ordering his
    corpse to be thrown into the common burying-place among poor
    strangers. He expresses most feeling sentiments of compunction,
    and gives his blessing to his disciples, with a prediction of
    divine mercy in their favor; but excepts two among them, Aruad and
    Paulonas, both persons famed for eloquence; yet he foresaw that
    they would afterward apostatize from the Catholic faith. The whole
    city was assembled before the saint’s door, every one being bathed
    in tears; and all strove to get as near to him as possible, and to
    listen to his last instructions. A&nbsp;lady of great quality
    named Lamprotata, falling at his feet, begged his leave to buy a
    coffin for his interment; to which he assented, on condition that
    it should be a very mean one, and that the lady would promise to
    renounce all vanities in a spirit of penance, and never again to
    be carried on the shoulders of men, or in a chair; all which she
    cheerfully engaged herself to perform. The saint, having ceased to
    speak, continued in silent prayer till he calmly gave up his soul
    to God. He died in a very advanced age about the year 378. His
    festival was kept at Edessa immediately after his death. On it
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa soon after spoke his panegyric at the
    request of one Ephrem, who having been taken captive by the
    Ismaelites had recommended himself to this saint his patron, and
    had been wonderfully delivered from his chains and from many
    dangers. St.&nbsp;Gregory closes his discourse with this address
    to the saint. “You are now assisting at the divine altar, and
    before the prince of life with the angels, praising the most holy
    Trinity: remember us all, and obtain for us the pardon of our
    sins.” The true Martyrology of Bede calls the 9th of July the day
    of his deposition; which agrees with Palladius, who places his
    death in harvest-time, though the Latins have long kept his
    festival on the 1st of February, and the&nbsp;Greeks on the 28th
    of January. His perpetual tears, far from disfiguring his face,
    made it appear more serene and beautiful, and his very aspect
    raised the veneration of all who beheld him. The Greeks paint him
    very tall, bent with old age, of a sweet and beautiful
    countenance, with his eyes swimming in tears, and the venerable
    marks of sanctity in his looks and habit.</p>

    Saint Austin says, that Adam in paradise praised God and did not
    sigh; but in our present state, a principal function of our prayer
    consists in sighs and compunction.<a id="c9_1l"> </a>Divine love,
    as St.&nbsp;Gregory observes,<a
      href="#fn_83"
      class="anchor">83</a>
    our banishment from God, our dangers, our past sins, our daily
    offences, and the weight of our own spiritual miseries, and those
    of the whole world, call upon us continually to weep, at least
    spiritually and in the desire of our heart, if we cannot always
    with our eyes. Every object round about us suggests many motives
    to excite our tears. We ought to mingle them even with our hymns
    of praise and love. Can we make an act of divine love without
    being pierced with bitter grief and contrition, reflecting that we
    have been so base and ungrateful as to have offended our
    infinitely good God? Can we presume without trembling to sing his
    praises with our impure affections, or to pronounce his adorable
    name with our defiled lips? And do we not first endeavor by tears
    of compunction to wash away the stains of our souls, begging to be
    sprinkled and cleansed by hyssop dipped, not in the blood of sheep
    or goats, but in the blood of the spotless lamb who died to take
    away the sins of the world? If the most innocent among the saints
    weeps continually from motives of holy love, how much more ought
    the sinner to mourn!<a id="c9_1m"> </a>“The voice of the turtle
    hath been heard in our land.”<a
      href="#fn_84"
      class="anchor">84</a>
    If the turtle, the emblem of innocence and fidelity, makes its
    delight to mourn solitary in this desert, what ought not the
    unfaithful soul to do? The penitent sinner, instead of the sighs
    of the turtle, ought to pour forth his grief in loud groans,
    imitating the doleful cries of the ostrich, and in torrents of
    tears, by which the deepest sorrow for having offended so good a
    God, forces his broken heart to give it vent.</p>

    ON THE WRITINGS OF SAINT EPHREM.</h3>
  <div class="blk5 smfont">
    <p>
      The first volume of the Vatican edition of this father’s works
      begins with his sermon On Virtues and Vices. He expresses in it
      a surprise to see the full seek food from him who was empty, and
      says he is confounded to speak, seeing every word would accuse
      and condemn himself. However, trembling, he recommends to his
      hearers the fear of God; charity, by which we are meek, patient,
      tender to all, desirous to serve, give to all; hope, and
      longanimity, by which we bear all; patience, meekness, sweetness
      to all; inviolable love of truth in the smallest things,
      obedience, temperance, &amp;c., and speaks against all the
      contrary vices, envy, detraction,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
    <p>
      His two Confessions or Reprehensions of himself are only
      effusions of his heart in these dispositions. The first he
      begins as follows: “Have pity on me, all ye that have bowels of
      compassion.” Then he earnestly begs their prayers that he may
      find mercy with God, though he was from his infancy an useless
      abandoned vessel. He laments his spiritual miseries in the most
      moving words, declaring that he trembles lest, as flames from
      heaven devoured him who presumed to offer profane fire on the
      altar, so he should meet with the same judgment for appearing
      before God in prayer without having the fire of his divine love
      in his heart. He invites all men to weep and pray for him,
      making a public confession of the failings which his pure lights
      discovered in his affections; for in these, notwithstanding his
      extraordinary progress in the contrary virtues, he seemed to
      himself to discern covetousness, jealousy, and sloth, though he
      appeared of all men the most remote from the very shadow of
      those vices; and by tears of compunction he studied more and
      more to purify his heart, that God might vouchsafe perfectly to
      reign in it. The second part of this work is a bitter accusation
      of his pride; which sin, as he adds, destroys even the gifts of
      God in a soul, blasts all her virtues, and renders them a most
      filthy abomination; for all our virtues will be tried at the
      last day by a fire which only humility can stand. He laments how
      pride infects the whole world; that some, by a strange frenzy,
      seek to gratify it in earthly fooleries, and the most silly
      vanities, on which the opinion of madmen has stamped a pretended
      dignity and imaginary value. He laments bitterly, that even
      spiritual men are in danger of sinning, by taking pride in
      virtue itself, though this be the pure gift of God; and when by
      his mercy we are enriched with it, we are, nevertheless, base
      and unprofitable servants.</p>
    <p>
      In his second Reprehension of himself, after having elegantly
      demonstrated a particular providence inspecting and governing
      the minutest affairs and circumstances, he grievously accuses
      himself of having entertained a doubt of it in his youth, before
      his conversion to God. He condemns himself as guilty of
      vain-glory, sloth, lukewarmness, immortification, irreverence in
      the church, talkativeness, contentiousness, and other sins. He
      fears lest his repentance should be like that of Esau, and begs
      the pity and prayers of all men for an infamous blind leper. He
      weeps to see that some men had conceived an esteem for him to
      whom none was due; and he cries out to them—“Take off my false
      covering, and you will see in me nothing but worms, stench, and
      filth: remove the cloak of hypocrisy, and you will find me a
      hideous and nauseous sepulchre.” He compares himself to the
      Pharisees, as wearing only the habit of the prophets and saints,
      to his heavier condemnation; for vice, covered with a mask of
      virtue, is always more odious and detestable. In another
      Confession (t.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;439), after accusing himself of
      sloth, pride, uncharitableness, and other sins, he most movingly
      entreats all men to weep for him; wishing they could see the
      extreme miseries of his heart, which could not fail most
      powerfully to excite their compassion, though they could not be
      able to bear the hideous sight of the load of his monstrous
      iniquities.</p>
    <p>
      His treatise on the Passions is of the same nature, a
      lamentation that from his infancy he had been a contemner of
      grace, and slothful to virtue, strengthened daily his passions,
      and groaned in the midst of snares which made him fear to live
      lest he should go on relapsing into sloth.</p>
    <p>
      He has left us many tracts on Compunction, which indeed all his
      writings breathe. In the first which bears this title, he
      invites all, rich and poor, old and young, to join him in
      weeping, to purchase eternal life and to be delivered from
      everlasting death: by weeping and crying to see with the blind
      man in the gospel, the soul will be enlightened to see her
      miseries. God, the angels, all heaven expect and invite us
      earnestly to these tears: God’s terrible judgment is at hand
      which he describes, and then adds, to prevent its justice we
      must weep not one day only, but all the days of our life, as
      David did, in affliction, continual prayer, austerities, and
      alms. The narrow gate does not admit others; the Judge will
      exclude those who sought their joy on earth and pampered their
      flesh. Then it will be too late to trim our lamps, or seek for
      the oil of good works; then no more poor will stand at any door
      for us to redeem our sins by alms. He laments our spiritual
      miseries, especially his sins and sloth continued all his life
      now to the eleventh hour. He awakes his soul by the short time
      that remains, and that uncertain too.</p>
    <p>
      In his second he relates, that going out of Edessa early one
      morning, accompanied with two brethren, and beholding the
      heavens beautifully spangled with bright stars, he said to
      himself—“If the lustre of these luminaries be so dazzling, how
      will the saints shine when Christ shall come in glory! But
      suddenly the thought of that terrible day struck my mind, and
      I&nbsp;trembled in all my joints, and was seized with
      convulsions, and in an agony of fear, sighing and overwhelmed
      with a flood of tears, I&nbsp;cried out in bitter anguish of
      mind: ‘How shall I&nbsp;be then found! How shall I&nbsp;stand
      before that tribunal! A&nbsp;monster infected with pride among
      the humble and the perfect, a goat among the sheep, and a barren
      tree without fruit. The martyrs will show their torment, and the
      monks their virtues; but thou, alas! O&nbsp;sinful, vain, and
      arrogant soul, wilt only bear thy sloth and negligence.’” His
      two companions, moved by the excess of his tears, wept with
      him.</p>
    <p>
      In his Discourse, that we ought never to laugh with a worldly
      joy, but to always weep, he enforces the obligation of perpetual
      compunction and tears.</p>
    <p>
      In his ascetic Sermon, he says grief and zeal compel him to
      speak, but his unworthiness and his sins persuade him to be
      silent, his eyes delight only in tears to bewail night and day
      in floods the wounds of his soul, and above all that pride which
      conceals them from him. He laments tepidity and love of earthly
      things should be found among monks, and that some interrupt
      their mortifications, weeping one day and laughing the next,
      lying one night on the ground, the next on a soft bed, whereas
      all our life ought to be a course of penance; he extols the
      humility and constant mortification of the ancient and all true
      monks, like shining diamonds in the world. The rest of this long
      discourse is a vehement exhortation of the monks to fervor and
      zeal, this life being a time of traffic, and very short, and a
      nothing; the recompense immense, and the rigor of God’s justice
      terrible to all. He pronounces woes to himself in the confusion
      he expected in the last day before all who esteemed him here.
      Begs earnestly all pray for him. One of the principal means to
      preserve this fervor, is a strict examen every night and
      morning. A&nbsp;trader casts up every day his losses and gains,
      and is solicitous to repair any losses; so do you, says he,
      every morning and night make up your accounts carefully; examine
      yourself: Have I&nbsp;to-day spoken any idle words, despised
      any, &amp;c.? Have I&nbsp;this night watched, prayed, &amp;c.?
      He advises not to undertake too much in austerities, but such as
      the soul will not relax in, than which nothing is more
      pernicious.</p>
    <p>
      His parænetic Sermon is also addressed to young monks, whom he
      advises to the continual presence of God in their minds most
      earnestly under temptations. Against sloth, he observes, this
      succeeding fervor by fits makes a life one chain of risings and
      falling again; building by mortification and destroying again by
      relaxing. He bids them have this inscription in the beginning of
      their book: Sloth banished for ever and ever from my soul.</p>
    <p>
      His two sermons on the Fathers deceased, are also to monks,
      showing and lamenting their tepidity by the fervor of their
      fathers in the deserts. His Hypomnisticon is an exhortatory
      epistle to the same.</p>
    <p>
      His treatise on Virtue is to a novice; he tells him obedience
      has no merit unless in hard and harsh things, for even wild
      beasts grow tame by mild treatment.</p>
    <p>
      Next follows his book in Imitation of Proverbs, in definitions
      and strong sentences on all virtues, in which he teaches tears
      in prayer are the beginning of a good life; vain-glory is like
      a worm in a tree. He speaks much on humility, presumption,
      charity, tears out of the desire of eternal happiness, and weeps
      to consider his own wretchedness and poverty.</p>
    <p>
      His treatise for the Correction of those who live wickedly, is
      full of zeal, humility, and an extraordinary contempt of
      himself, and spirit of compunction.</p>
    <p>
      That on Penance is a pathetic exhortation to sinners to return
      by the mercy of God, who expects them before the dawning of the
      day of life which is coming on; by the comfort which the angels
      will receive, and from the frightful trial at the last day,
      against which he prays for himself.</p>
    <p>
      His discourse On the Fear of Souls, is a lamentation and prayer
      for himself at the sight of the heavens, still in stronger
      expressions and tears.</p>
    <p>
      His sermon On the Second Coming of Christ, shows the joy of the
      blessed, and exaggerates the severity of that trial from the
      immensity of God’s benefits to us.</p>
    <p>
      In his Tetrasyllabus he explains how the devil vanquished by
      the fervent, always says, I&nbsp;will then go to my friends, the
      slothful, where I&nbsp;shall have no labor, nor want stratagems.
      I&nbsp;have but to fetter them in the chains with which they are
      pleased, and I&nbsp;shall have them always willing subjects. He
      exhorts all therefore to constant fervor. In another place he
      exhorts all continually to repeat to themselves against sloth;
      “Yet a little of thy journey remains and thou wilt arrive at thy
      place of rest. Then take thy rest not now on the road.”</p>
    <p>
      In his book on those words, <i>Attende Tibi</i>, to a monk, he
      presses the precept of being always fervent, never relaxing, in
      every virtue, especially in purity; and adds the example of
      St.&nbsp;Anthony, who, as St.&nbsp;Athanasius relates,
      notwithstanding his great mortifications, which he never relaxed
      from his youth to his old age, would never bathe or so much as
      wash his feet, or ever suffered any part of his body to be seen,
      except his face and hands, till after his death.</p>
    <p>
      He has left us an excellent long prayer for a soul to say
      in time of any temptation; another for grace and pardon of
      sins.</p>
    <p>
      A&nbsp;novice among the monks often had begged of
      St.&nbsp;Ephrem some direction. The saint extols his zeal and
      humility in desiring advice from a sinner, whose intolerable
      stench infects all his works. His first lesson to him is that he
      always remember the presence of God, and avoid all unnecessary
      words. He recommends then to him, in ninety-six lessons, perfect
      obedience, abstinence, silence, solitude, which frees a man from
      three dangers, viz., of the eyes, ears, and tongue; never to
      have so much compassion for any novice as to offend God, and so
      perish with him; if he be tepid, it is better he should perish
      alone than you also by condescension; never to speak to a
      superior in favor of an expelled brother, without most evident
      proofs of his perfect conversion; for a little spark falling
      into a barn, easily destroys all the labors of a whole year: to
      avoid frequent long conversations with any young man about piety
      or other things, for fear of fond love; never to desire anything
      great or public, for God’s honor, but rather to love to be hid
      and unknown; many in dens and deserts were the greatest saints,
      but without humility the most glorious virtues and the greatest
      actions are lost; never to seek the care of souls, but to employ
      in it the utmost diligence, if it be laid upon him: always to
      walk in the narrow way of compunction and mourning. His other
      lessons conduce to humility and other virtues.</p>
    <p>
      His fifty-five Beatitudes comprise the happiness of all virtues,
      as of ever glorifying God, which is to be as the cherubim and
      seraphim. He closes them bursting into tears at the reflection
      how far he is from any of them by his sloth under a holy garb,
      and how distant from the holy servants of God, who persevered
      some in sackcloth and chains, others on pillars, others in
      enclosure and fasting, others in obedience, &amp;c. He adds
      twenty other beatitudes.</p>
    <p>
      His book of one hundred chapters on humility, consists chiefly
      of short examples; as, a certain novice always kept silence.
      Some said to him, He is silent because he knows not how to
      speak. Others said, No, but it is because he has a devil. He,
      hearing all this, gave no answer, but glorified God in his
      heart.</p>
    <p>
      In the second volume we have the life of St.&nbsp;Abraham; a
      long panegyric on the Patriarch Joseph; a sermon on the
      Transfiguration; one on the Last Judgment, and on the necessity
      and advantage of spending this life in tears; a treatise of
      ninety chapters on the right way of living; fifty paræneses or
      exhortations to the monks, on obedience, humility, &amp;c.; a
      most pathetic sermon on the second coming of Christ, in which he
      expresses himself as follows: “Beloved of Christ, lend a
      favorable attention to what I&nbsp;am going to say on the
      dreadful coming of our Lord. Remembering that hour,
      I&nbsp;tremble with an excess of fear. For who can relate those
      horrible things? what tongue can express them? When the King of
      kings, arising from his throne of glory, shall descend, and sit
      the just judge, calling to an account all the inhabitants of the
      earth. At this thought I&nbsp;am ready to swoon away: my limbs
      quake for fear, my eyes swim in tears, my voice fails, my lips
      shrink, my tongue falters, and my thoughts are wrapt up in
      silence. I&nbsp;am obliged to denounce these things to you; yet
      fear will not suffer me to speak. A&nbsp;loud thunder now
      affrights us; how then shall we stand at the sound of the last
      trumpet, louder than any thunder, summoning the dead to rise!
      Then the bones of all men in the bowels of the earth, hearing
      this voice, shall suddenly run, and seek out their joints; and,
      in the twinkling of an eye, we shall see all men risen and
      assembled to judgment. The great king shall command, and
      instantly the earth quaking, and the troubled sea shall give up
      the dead which they possess, whether devoured by fish, beast, or
      fowl. All in a moment shall appear present, and not a hair will
      be wanting.” He goes on describing the frightful fire consuming
      all things on the earth; the angels separating the sheep and the
      goats; the standard of the great king, that cross on which he
      was nailed, shining bright, and borne before him; men standing
      to meet this tremendous majesty, revolving their own deeds; the
      just with joy, the wicked worse than dead with fear; the angels
      and cherubim appearing, singing, Holy, Holy, Holy; the heavens
      opened, and the King of kings revealed in such incomparable
      glory, that the heavens and the earth will fly from before his
      face. “Who then,” says he, “can stand? He places before our eyes
      the books opened, and all our actions, thoughts, and words
      called to an account!” He then cries out: “What tears ought we
      not to shed night and day without intermission, for that
      terrible appearance!” Here the venerable old man was no longer
      able to break through his sighs and tears, and stood silent. The
      auditory cried out—“Tell us what more terrible things will
      follow.” He answered, “Then all mankind will stand with eyes
      cast down, between life and death, heaven and damnation, before
      the tribunal; and all degrees of men shall be called to a
      rigorous examination. Wo to me! I&nbsp;desire to tell you what
      things will follow, but my voice fails me through fear, and
      I&nbsp;am lost in confusion and anxiety; the very rehearsal of
      these things is most dreadful.” The audience repeated again:
      “Tell us the rest, for God’s sake, for our advantage and
      salvation.” He therefore proceeded, “Then, beloved of Christ,
      shall be required in all Christians the seal of baptism, entire
      faith, and that beautiful renunciation which they made before
      witnesses, saying, I&nbsp;renounce Satan, and all his works; not
      one, or two, or five, but all the works of the devil. In that
      hour this renunciation will be demanded of us, and happy is he
      who shall have kept it faithfully as he promised.” Here, he
      stopping in tears, they cried again: “Tell us also what follows
      this.” He answered: “I&nbsp;will tell you in my grief,
      I&nbsp;will speak through my sighs and tears; these things
      cannot be related without tears, for they are extremely
      dreadful.” The people entreated again: “O&nbsp;servant of God,
      we beseech you to instruct us fully.” The holy man, again
      striking his breast, and weeping bitterly, said: “O&nbsp;my
      brethren, beloved of Christ, how sorrowful, and how frightful
      things do you desire to hear! O&nbsp;terrible hour! Wo to me, wo
      to me! Who will dare to relate, or who will bear to hear this
      last and horrible rehearsal; all you who have tears, sigh with
      me! and you who have not, hear what will befall you; and let us
      not neglect our
      salvation. Then shall they be separated, without hopes of ever
      returning to each other again, bishops from fellow-bishops,
      priests from fellow-priests, deacons from fellow-deacons,
      subdeacons and lectors from their fellows; those who were kings
      as the basest slaves; children from parents; friends from
      kindred and intimates. Then princes, philosophers, wise men of
      the world, seeing themselves thus parted, shall cry out to the
      saints with bitter tears; ‘Farewell eternally, saints and
      servants of God; farewell parents, children, relations, and
      friends; farewell prophets, apostles, and martyrs; farewell Lady
      Mother of God; you prayed much for us that we might be saved,
      but we would not. Farewell life-giving cross; farewell paradise
      of delights, kingdom without end, the heavenly Jerusalem.
      Farewell ye all; we shall never more behold one of you,
      hastening to our torment without end or rest,’”&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
    <p>
      A&nbsp;Sermon on fraternal Charity, and on the Last Judgment, in
      which his tears again hindered him from pursuing his subject.
      Nothing can be more terrifying or more moving than these
      discourses, or than the next on Antichrist, or that after on the
      Cross, or that of Interrogations. There follow his Testament,
      his Sermon on the Cross and on Charity, in which he salutes and
      honors that holy instrument of our redemption in the strongest
      words and highest epithets, which, as he says, all nations
      adore, and which saving sign we mark on our doors, foreheads,
      eyes, mouths, breast, and our whole body. His Sermon against
      heretics on the precious margarite, to prove the Virgin Mary
      mother of God; that on the vice of the tongue; his Panegyric on
      St.&nbsp;Basil; his Sermon on the Sinful Woman in the gospel; on
      the Forty Martyrs; on Abraham and Isaac; on Daniel and the three
      children. Sermons on the eight capital bad thoughts; gluttony,
      fornication, avarice, anger, sadness, sloth, vain-glory, and
      pride; on perfection, on patience, and suffering; and many small
      tracts to monks. One contains a relation of a holy virgin in a
      monastery of three hundred, who was never seen eating, but
      worked washing the dishes and cleaning the scullery, feigning
      herself a fool, and bearing blows and all insults without
      murmuring or answering a word; called by derision, Salla or
      Sallop. St.&nbsp;Pityrumus, an anchoret, was admonished by an
      angel to go and see in her one who surpassed him and the others
      in virtue: having seen all the nuns he found not her, she being
      left behind in the kitchen. At his desire, which all laughed at,
      she was brought out. The anchoret immediately fell at her feet,
      crying, “Bless me, Amma” (<i>i. e.</i> spiritual mother). She
      also fell at his feet. The nuns said to him, “Don’t incur such a
      disgrace; this is Salla.” “No (said he), you are all Salæ.” Upon
      this all honored her, and one confessed, that she had thrown on
      her the washings of the dishes; another had struck her; another
      had thrust mustard up her nostrils, &amp;c. She not bearing
      esteem, retired thence unknown, and was never more heard of.</p>
    <p>
      The third volume contains many Sermons and Discourses, chiefly
      on the judgments of God and the last day; on penance,
      compunction, prayer, charity, and other virtues; and on vices
      and passions. Also the life of St.&nbsp;Julian the anchoret.
      Pious poems and several panegyrics of, and prayers to the
      Blessed Virgin, whose virginity and dignity of mother of God he
      clearly asserts.</p>
    <p>
      The fourth volume consists of his Commentaries on the five books
      of Moses, on Joshua, Judges, and the four books of Kings.
      St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa says, he studied and meditated
      assiduously on the holy scriptures, and expounded them all from
      the first book of Genesis to the last in the New Testament, with
      an extraordinary light, with which the Holy Ghost filled him.
      Many other Oriental writers testify the same. His exposition
      is very literal, full, and learned; nothing escapes him in
      them.</p>
    <p>
      The fifth volume gives us his Commentaries on Job and on all the
      prophets. Eleven sermons on several passages of holy scripture,
      in which he exhorts principally to avoid all occasions of sin,
      and to perpetual tears and penance. Thirteen sermons on the
      birth of Christ; and fifty-six polemical sermons against
      heresies, viz. of the Marcionites, Manicheans, especially their
      judiciary astrology; of the Novatians, Messalians, &amp;c. His
      zeal was moved seeing these errors spread in his country. He
      employs the Church’s authority, scriptures, and reasons to
      confute them.</p>
    <p>
      The sixth volume gives us ninety other polemical Discourses
      against the Arian and Eunomian heretics or Searchers, as he
      calls them, because they attempted to penetrate the divine
      mysteries, and the incomprehensible nature of God himself. They
      are equally solid and strong; not dry, as most writings of
      controversy, but full of unction and of the greatest sentiments
      of devotion, and an inexpressible ardor to ever love and praise
      our great God and Redeemer. His sermon against the Jews is no
      less remarkable.</p>
    <p>
      His Necrosima or eighty-five funeral canons, were written on
      Death and God’s judgments, which he had always before his eyes.
      He teaches evidently in them the use of ecclesiastical funeral
      rites and prayers at burials; that the souls of the departed
      immediately are judged by a particular judgment; the good
      immediately admitted to the enjoyment of God; those who die
      without having expiated venial sin, suffer in the flames of
      purgatory till it be satisfied for, but are relieved by the
      sacrifices, prayers, and other pious works of the faithful on
      earth. Of these fifty-four are short funeral discourses on the
      death of bishops, monks, and persons of all conditions. They are
      full of his extreme fear of the divine judgment, and a great
      contempt of the vanity of the world. He says in the eighty-first
      canon, “Entering on so long and dangerous a journey, I&nbsp;have
      my viaticum, thee, O&nbsp;Son of God; when hungry, I&nbsp;will
      eat thee, repairer of mankind; so it shall be, that no fire will
      dare approach my members, for it will not be able to bear the
      sweet saving odor of thy body and blood,” &amp;c. He uses the
      same motive of confidence of immortality, from being fed with
      the body and blood of Christ, and employs that endearing divine
      grace to move God to have mercy on him. He repeats the same
      prayer in his thirteenth Parænesis. Nothing can be clearer than
      the texts collected by Ceillier (t.&nbsp;8, p.&nbsp;101) from
      the writings of St.&nbsp;Ephrem, in favor of the real presence
      of the sacred body of Christ in the holy eucharist. See on them
      the judicious remarks of an able critic, Mém. de Trev.
      Jan.&nbsp;1756, p.&nbsp;55.</p>
    <p>
      Here follow four sermons on Freewill; also seventy-six moving
      Paræneses or exhortations to penance. In the forty-second, he
      tells us, that when he lay down to take a little repose in the
      night, he reflected on the excessive and boundless love of God,
      and instantly rose again to pay him the tribute of the most
      fervent praise and thanks he was able. “But being deterred,”
      says he, “by the remembrance of my sins, I&nbsp;began to melt
      into tears, and should have been disturbed beyond my strength,
      had not the thief, the publican, the sinful woman, the Cananean,
      the Samaritan, and other examples of mercy, given me comfort and
      courage.” He says that at other times, when he was going to fall
      asleep, the remembrance of his sins banished all thoughts of
      giving rest to his wearied body, and made sleep yield to sighs,
      groans, and floods of tears, to which he invited himself by the
      example of the penitent David, washing his bed with briny
      torrents; for the silence of night is the most proper season for
      our tears. It appears he composed this work, at least part, a
      little before his death; for in the forty-third Parænesis he
      writes, “I&nbsp;Ephrem am now dying. I&nbsp;write my last will
      and testament to all lovers of truth, who shall rise up after
      me. Persevere night and day in prayer. The husbandman reapeth a
      great crop by assiduous labor; so will you, if you never
      interrupt your devotion. Pray without ceasing.”</p>
    <p>
      His book in fifteen elegant discourses on the Terrestrial
      Paradise, explaining its history in Genesis, and comforting
      himself with the name and happiness of the good thief on the
      cross, makes a transition to the heavenly Paradise, on the
      felicity of which he speaks with incredible joy and pleasure.
      In his eighth discourse he teaches the soul cannot perfectly see
      God before the resurrection; but means by the perfectly complete
      enjoyment, for he is very express (loc. cit. supra) that the
      blessed behold God immediately on their death; as Muratori
      demonstrates against Burnet, in his dissertation on Paradise,
      c.&nbsp;2.</p>
    <p>
      Eighteen very devout sermons on divers subjects close his works;
      on Christ’s Nativity and Resurrection; on Prayer, on Humility,
      which he teaches is the weapon our Redeemer conquered hell by,
      and has put into our hands as our principal and only armor
      against our spiritual enemies.</p>
    <p>
      The works of this father demonstrate the uniformity in faith of
      the Syriac church in the fourth century, with that of the
      universal church of all ages.</p>
    <p>
      Several of St.&nbsp;Ephrem’s works were translated into Latin,
      and published at Rome in 1589, by Gerard Vossius or Volkens,
      provost of Tongres. A&nbsp;Greek edition of the same was printed
      at Oxford in 1709, by the care of Mr.&nbsp;Edward Thwaites.
      A&nbsp;more complete edition of this father’s works was given to
      the public at Rome in six volumes in folio, in 1732 and 1743,
      under the direction of cardinal Querini, librarian of the
      Vatican, and Monsignor Joseph Assemani, first prefect of the
      same library. In this we have the original Syriac text of a good
      part of these works, and the ancient Greek version of the rest.
      The Latin translation is the work partly of Gerard Vossius,
      partly of F.&nbsp;Peter Benedetti, a Maronite Jesuit who lived
      at Rome; and in the last volumes of Stephen Assemani archbishop
      of Apamea, who also published the Chaldaic acts of the Martyrs,
      and is nephew of the aforesaid Joseph Assemani. The Greek text
      in the last volumes, especially in the sixth, is published very
      incorrect. See Mémoires de Trevoux for January, 1756,
      p.&nbsp;146.</p>

    THE MARTYRS OF GORCUM.</h3>
  <p>
    Nineteen priests and religious men, who were taken by the
    Calvinists in Gorcum, after suffering many insults, were hanged on
    account of their religion at Bril, on the 9th of July, 1572. Of
    these, eleven were Franciscan friars, called Recollects, of the
    convent of Gorcum, amongst whom were Nicholas Pick the guardian,
    and Jerom Werden, vicar of the same convent. The former was
    thirty-eight years old, an eminent preacher, and a man endued with
    the primitive spirit of his order, especially the love of holy
    poverty and mortification. He feared the least superfluity even in
    the meanest and most necessary things, especially in meals; and he
    would often say: “I&nbsp;fear if St.&nbsp;Francis were living, he
    would not approve of this or that.” He was most zealous to
    preserve this spirit of poverty and penance in his house, and he
    used to call property and superfluity the bane of a religious
    state. His constant cheerfulness rendered piety and penance itself
    amiable. He often had these words in his mouth: “We must always
    serve God with cheerfulness.” He had frequently expressed an
    earnest desire to die a martyr, but sincerely confessed himself
    altogether unworthy of that honor.<a id="c9_3a"> </a>The other
    martyrs were a Dominican, two Norbertins, one Canon Regular of
    St.&nbsp;Austin, called John Oosterwican,<a
      href="#fn_85"
      class="anchor">85</a>
    three curates, and another secular priest. The first of these
    curates was Leonard Vechel, the elder pastor at Gorcum. He had
    gained great reputation in his theological studies at Louvain
    under the celebrated Ruard Tapper; and in the discharge of
    pastoral duties at Gorcum, had joined an uncommon zeal, piety,
    eloquence, and learning with such success, that his practice and
    conduct in difficult cases was a rule for other curates of the
    country, and his decisions were regarded as oracles at the
    university itself. For the relief of the poor, especially those
    that were sick, he gave his temporal substance with such
    tenderness and profusion as to seem desirous, had it been
    possible, to have given them himself. He reproved vice without
    respect to persons; and by his invincible meekness and patience
    disarmed and conquered many who had been long deaf to all his
    remonstrances, and added only insults to their obstinacy. Nicholas
    Poppel was the second pastor at Gorcum, and though inferior in
    abilities, was in zeal worthy to be the colleague of Vechel, and
    to attain to the same crown with him. The rest of this happy
    company had made their lives an apprenticeship to martyrdom. They
    were declared martyrs, and beatified by Clement&nbsp;X. in 1674.<a
    id="c9_3b"> </a>The relation of several miracles performed by
    their intercession and relics which was sent to Rome in order to
    their beatification, is published by the Bollandists.<a
      href="#fn_86"
      class="anchor">86</a>
    The greatest part of their relics is kept in the church of the
    Franciscan friars at Brussels, whither they were secretly conveyed
    from Bril. See the accurate history of their martyrdom written by
    the learned doctor William Estius, printed at Douay in 1603. Also

    ST.&nbsp;EVERILDIS,&nbsp;V. IN&nbsp;ENGLAND.</h3>
  <p>
    Kinegils, king of the West-Saxons, having been baptized by
    St.&nbsp;Berinus in 635, this holy virgin had the happiness of
    being brought to the knowledge of Christ. In order to devote
    herself most perfectly to the service and love of her heavenly
    spouse, she fled secretly from the house of her parents to seek
    some holy monastery of nuns, and was joined in the way by two
    other virgins named Bega and Wuldreda. St.&nbsp;Wilfrid gave her
    a spot called before the Bishop’s Dwelling, but since her time
    Everildisham, that is, the dwelling of Everildis. Neither
    F.&nbsp;Alford nor F.&nbsp;Solier were able to find the situation
    of this place. Here she trained up many virgins to the perfection
    of divine love, the summit of Christian virtue, by animating them
    with the true spirit, and continually encouraging them in the most
    fervent and most faithful discharge of all the duties, and
    application to all the exercises of their holy profession. She
    went to God on the 9th of July, on which day Solier the Bollandist
    found her name in an ancient copy of Usuard’s Martyrology.
    F.&nbsp;Alford sent to Bollandus a transcript of lessons used
    formerly in some church now unknown. Her name does not occur in
    any English or Irish Calendar now extant, nor has Alford mentioned

    A. D. 1727.</p>
  <p>
    We earnestly beseech the devout reader, whilst he is reading the
    life of her whose wonderful history we are about to relate, not to
    decide upon its merits, until he shall have carefully considered,
    not only the events themselves, but how, in every case, the graces
    which the servant of God received, are not only remarkable signs
    of Divine favor, but ever produced in her heart deeper humility,
    more ardent charity, and a wish to conceal them from the eyes of
    men;—that they were particularly communicated to her during
    prayer;—and that, to the desire of suffering for the sake of Jesus
    Christ, she added the most rigorous mortification of her flesh;
    all which the immortal pontiff, Benedict&nbsp;XIV., has laid down
    as criterions whereby to determine the reality of such
    supernatural gifts. In order to glorify his servant, it pleased
    God, during her lifetime, to make known her virtues and the graces
    which he had conferred upon her, to many of her companions, and to
    no less than four bishops of the city wherein she lived, and
    thirteen religious men of various orders, who were her directors,
    by whom an exact and faithful record of all her actions has been
    handed down to us. From their attestations, and other authentic
    accounts, the following narrative has been formed of actions and
    virtues which many volumes would not be sufficient to detail.</p>
  <p>
    Saint Veronica Giuliani was born on the Feast of St.&nbsp;John the
    Evangelist, in 1660, at Mercatello, in the States of the Church.
    She received in baptism the name of Ursula, for God destined her,
    like that holy martyr, to be a virgin and the leader of many other
    virgins to the kingdom of heaven. In her very infancy her future
    sanctity was foreshadowed; for, on Wednesday, Friday, and
    Saturday, which the Church keeps as days of penance, she would
    never take nourishment, save a small quantity in the morning and
    the evening:<a id="c9_5a"> </a>and before she was six months old,
    seeing a picture representing the most Blessed Trinity, in whose
    honor that day was dedicated (12th June, 1661), she left her
    mother’s arms of her own accord, and, without any assistance
    whatever, walked to it, and with many signs of reverence, remained
    as if enchanted before it;<a
      href="#fn_87"
      class="anchor">87</a>
    and being carried, at the age of a year and a half, to a shop, by
    a servant who wanted some soil, in selling which the shopkeeper
    used a false measure, her tongue was loosed, and she cried out, in
    a clear voice, “Act fairly, for God sees you.” At the age of three
    years, these seeds of virtue began to develope themselves still
    more. They produced in her those extraordinary feelings of love
    and affection towards Our Blessed Saviour and his Virgin Mother,
    which have only been communicated to the most favored souls. When
    she was about four years of age, her mother fell so dangerously
    ill, that the Viaticum was brought to her. The moment the priest
    entered the house, Ursula saw such a bright light surrounding him,
    that she ran to him, and earnestly begged to receive the blessed
    sacrament. To keep her quiet, she was told that there were no more
    particles left; but she at once answered, that, he might safely
    break a portion off that intended for her mother, because, as the
    mirror, when broken, does not cease to reflect the images that it
    represented when entire, so is Jesus equally present in the
    smallest fragment as well as in the entire host from which it has
    been separated. As soon as her mother had communicated, she sprang
    upon the bed, exclaiming, “O&nbsp;what sweet things you have had!”
    And coming near her mouth, she said, “O&nbsp;what a sweet scent!”
    Nor could the attendants succeed in making her leave her mother in
    peace. Before her death, she called her five children to her
    bed-side, and recommended each of them to one of the five wounds
    of the passion. To Ursula she gave that in our Saviour’s side; to
    which the devotion of her after-life was directed, and through it
    she received those many graces of which we shall afterwards speak.
    On the night following her mother’s death, she refused to go to
    bed, until the servants placed a picture of Our Lady and Jesus
    upon the bed, when she immediately lay down and slept
    peacefully.</p>
  <p>
    At the age of seven she was admitted to the sacrament of
    Confirmation, and, during the ceremony, her godmother saw her
    guardian angel by her side. Similar visions, which occurred in the
    seventh or eighth year of her age, we have recorded in her own
    words:—“I&nbsp;remember,” she says, “that when I&nbsp;was about
    seven or eight years old, twice during the Holy Week, Jesus
    appeared to me covered with wounds, and telling me to be devout to
    His most holy passion, instantly disappeared. I&nbsp;wept
    bitterly, and every time that I&nbsp;heard speak of the torments
    and sufferings of Our Lord, I&nbsp;felt something at my heart; and
    everything that I&nbsp;undertook I&nbsp;offered up in honor of His
    passion. A&nbsp;desire came into my head of asking my confessor
    for some mortification, but I&nbsp;did not yield to it. Still
    I&nbsp;made sufferings for myself, but all without my confessor’s
    leave; such as the discipline, walking on my bare knees, piercing
    myself with a pin, and beating myself with thistles. If
    I&nbsp;heard of the works of penance performed by others,
    I&nbsp;went to the image of my Saviour, and said, ‘Lord, if
    I&nbsp;had their instruments of mortification, I&nbsp;would do the
    same; but since I&nbsp;have them not, I&nbsp;offer Thee my
    desire.’ He has often let me know and remember that He made me (at
    that age) affectionate invitations. Thus, for example, when
    I&nbsp;had determined on taking some recreation, and could never
    find time to do so, I&nbsp;heard Jesus in my interior, asking me,
    ‘What dost thou seek, what dost thou desire? I&nbsp;am thy real
    contentment;’ and I&nbsp;at once replied, ‘Lord, for Thy sake
    I&nbsp;will deprive myself of the pleasure which I&nbsp;sought.’
    How these answers were uttered, I&nbsp;know not; but this
    I&nbsp;know, that I&nbsp;did make them.... Sometimes, whilst
    I&nbsp;was gazing at the crucifix, Jesus spoke to my heart, and
    said, ‘I&nbsp;will be Thy guide and spouse;’ and I&nbsp;stretched
    out my arms, and exclaimed, ‘I&nbsp;will be Thy spouse, and no one
    shall move me from it. I&nbsp;promise it with all my heart; grant
    that I&nbsp;may never separate myself from Thee.’”</p>
  <p>
    Her father having obtained a lucrative situation at Placentia,
    removed thither with his family. In that city, Ursula, who was
    about ten years old. made her first communion, on the feast of the
    Purification, in 1670. When she had received Our Lord, she felt an
    unusual fire burning within her breast, which continued after her
    return home; so that thinking it to be an ordinary effect in all
    communicants, she, in her innocent way, asked her sisters how long
    it generally lasted. But perceiving, from their surprise, that it
    was a special grace imparted by her Saviour, she did not again
    speak of it, but endeavored to receive the holy sacrament of love
    as frequently as possible.</p>
  <p>
    At this time the gift of mental prayer was communicated to her.
    In what manner she received it, the following account, which she
    wrote afterwards, by the command of her directors, will
    explain:—“When I&nbsp;was about twelve years of age, I&nbsp;think,
    a desire frequently came into my mind, of placing myself in mental
    prayer; but I&nbsp;did not know how to set about it. It seemed
    mere folly to ask my confessor to instruct me in it, because he
    knew my wickedness; and I&nbsp;thought that none ought to apply to
    it except the good and those who are really inclined to virtue;
    but in myself there was nothing but inconstancy, and want of
    perseverance. I&nbsp;went on making my altars, although, while
    I&nbsp;was making them, I&nbsp;felt at times an application of my
    mind to prayer. As soon as I&nbsp;had finished, I&nbsp;knelt down
    before them, and remained on my knees for a long time; but what
    I&nbsp;did I&nbsp;know not, for I&nbsp;was, so to speak, out of
    myself. I&nbsp;felt such pleasure, that I&nbsp;should not have
    cared to eat or do anything else. I&nbsp;desired that all
    creatures should love and honor God. I&nbsp;ran to ask my sisters
    to come and sing with me. They did so, and I&nbsp;felt great
    comfort therein. As soon as my father returned home, I&nbsp;led
    him to my altar, and induced him to say some prayers with me. When
    the Nativity drew near, I&nbsp;could not contain myself for joy;
    and several times, whilst I&nbsp;was looking at the representation
    of Our Lord in the crib, I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;saw Him surrounded
    with glory; He drew me to a union with Himself, but I&nbsp;know
    not how. Of this I&nbsp;spoke to no one, nor did I&nbsp;derive any
    profit therefrom, for I&nbsp;soon returned to my usual childish
    follies. On the day of communion, all my delight was to be about
    my altar. Although I&nbsp;knew not how to pray mentally, my mind
    became all recollected in God. I&nbsp;seemed to feel my Lord in a
    special manner within my heart. I&nbsp;placed myself in prayer;
    and the longer I&nbsp;was employed therein, the longer
    I&nbsp;wished to remain. I&nbsp;had a certain interior light that
    showed me the inconstancy of worldly things, and I&nbsp;was
    inclined to abandon everything. I&nbsp;knew no other good but God.
    These considerations strengthened my desire of becoming a
    religious. The desire of suffering, I&nbsp;think, I&nbsp;had from
    my infancy, and afterwards; but, alas! it profited me in nothing.
    I&nbsp;had no sooner left the altar, than I&nbsp;set about
    annoying some one or other.</p>
  <p>
    “Although I&nbsp;sought amusement in worldly diversions,
    I&nbsp;felt my mind wholly turned to God. As well as I&nbsp;can
    remember, the passion of my Redeemer moved me very much; at times
    even to tears. The more I&nbsp;exercised myself in mental prayer,
    the more tedious I&nbsp;found the things of the world. At times,
    I&nbsp;had some particular insight into myself; but this
    I&nbsp;did not mention to my confessor. It is true that such
    lights made me advance farther than ever in the way of prayer;
    and, in order that I&nbsp;might not be observed, I&nbsp;told the
    servant to call me early in the morning; she did so, and
    I&nbsp;rose at once. I&nbsp;remained in prayer for several hours,
    but what I&nbsp;did I&nbsp;cannot relate. I&nbsp;know that
    I&nbsp;was out of myself, and felt a willingness and desire to be
    employed in all the work of the house, but this was forbidden,
    lest it should injure me. I&nbsp;seldom rose up from prayer,
    before I&nbsp;had been told by the Lord that I&nbsp;was to be His
    spouse. Still I&nbsp;remained steadfast in my desire of entering a
    religious order, and this desire increased daily. When a festival
    occurred, I&nbsp;felt a flame in my heart, which set my whole soul
    on fire. I&nbsp;could not remain quiet, I&nbsp;ran about the house
    as if I&nbsp;were mad, and made people laugh at me. Sometimes all
    my delight was in making altars; and although, in my uncle’s
    house, this was not so easy as at home, I&nbsp;never left off
    making them. For work I&nbsp;had not much inclination, but
    I&nbsp;could do as much in an hour as another in a day. I&nbsp;did
    not care to learn anything, but whatever I&nbsp;saw done,
    I&nbsp;found myself able to do, and succeeded when I&nbsp;set
    about it. I&nbsp;was the torment of everybody, and yet all
    wished me well, and liked me better than my sisters. When
    I&nbsp;thought of this, it surprised me beyond measure. No one
    spoke harshly to me; and yet I&nbsp;performed all sorts of naughty
    tricks. I&nbsp;was naturally hasty, and whenever I&nbsp;was vexed,
    I&nbsp;stamped and beat the ground like a horse; and believe me,
    I&nbsp;did so through mere wickedness, for no one ever provoked me
    to it. At times I&nbsp;took a thing into my head, and wished it to
    turn out as I&nbsp;desired. I&nbsp;felt an internal reproach for
    not mortifying myself, but I&nbsp;paid no attention to it. It
    seemed to me, that whenever I&nbsp;placed myself in prayer, God
    gave me to understand what he wished me to do; but I&nbsp;thought
    it was a mere fancy of my own, although the same light returned to
    my soul. It improved me much in virtue, and I&nbsp;began to
    accustom myself to silence, which enabled me to apply better to
    prayer; and although I&nbsp;did not mortify myself, I&nbsp;was
    encouraged to do so. Thus, by degrees, I&nbsp;became more and more
    in love with suffering.<a id="c9_5b"> </a>Oftentimes I&nbsp;rose
    during the night, and spent a short time in prayer; I&nbsp;had a
    peculiar affection for it, which led to <i>application</i>, but
    not to <i>recollections</i>.<a
      href="#fn_88"
      class="anchor">88</a>
    In the manner here described I&nbsp;spent the last two years that
    I&nbsp;remained in the world, that is, the fourteenth and
    fifteenth of my age. Still I&nbsp;gave way to many vanities, and
    often felt satisfaction in them; but, at the same time,
    I&nbsp;felt the internal reproach, which did not let me rest until
    I&nbsp;had withdrawn from many amusements which I&nbsp;was used to
    seek.”</p>
  <p>
    These were the beginnings of those high gifts of prayer and
    contemplation to which she afterwards attained; but it must not be
    supposed that the exercise of them was at all times attended with
    comfort and delight to her soul; for her writings mention the
    violent repugnance of the flesh, the strong temptations, the
    obscurity of mind, and dryness of affection, with which she had to
    contend in the struggle between the world and grace.</p>
  <p>
    Besides these interior trials, her perseverance and constancy to
    her Virgin Spouse were put to the most severe test, in the
    endeavors made by her father and other relations to induce her to
    join in the vain and idle occupations of others in her state of
    life, and to yield to their repeated arguments and even snares, to
    induce her to enter the married state. “Our father wished,” she
    writes, “that I&nbsp;should be more finely dressed than others,
    and one day I&nbsp;wore one vanity, and another day another. He
    was so fond of me, that, when at home, he would always have me
    beside him. All this I&nbsp;complied with. But I&nbsp;began to
    perceive that he was not willing that I&nbsp;should become a nun,
    and he told me I&nbsp;must marry, and that as long as he lived
    I&nbsp;must not leave him. But this news filled me with sorrow,
    because every time he spoke in this manner, I&nbsp;felt a stronger
    desire of being a nun. I&nbsp;told others so, but no
    one would believe me, and everybody was against my intention,
    especially my father, who even shed tears, and told me positively
    that he would never consent; and in order to drive the thought out
    of my head, he brought other gentlemen into the house and then
    called me. In their presence, he promised me all sorts of
    pleasures and amusements, and they did the same. They talked about
    the things of the world, in order to persuade me to set my fancy
    upon them, but their discourses led me to a contrary desire. At
    that moment, worldly things appeared so disgusting, that
    I&nbsp;could not hear them mentioned; and more than once
    I&nbsp;told these persons that they must not speak again on such
    subjects, because the more I&nbsp;heard, the more my soul was
    withdrawn from them. But all that I&nbsp;said, availed me nothing;
    every day my martyrdom was renewed. I&nbsp;had patience for some
    time; but at last, I&nbsp;declared in their
    presence that such discourses disgusted me, and before them all,
    I&nbsp;expressed my deep commiseration for the wretchedness of the
    unfortunate persons who are attached to worldly things.
    I&nbsp;spoke as little as possible, because I&nbsp;knew that my
    father took great delight in hearing me talk, and I&nbsp;did
    everything in my power to diminish his attachment, by avoiding all
    those actions in which he took delight; but all to no purpose; his
    affections seemed to increase daily. At times, he said to me,
    ‘I&nbsp;wish to content you in everything; the only thing
    I&nbsp;beg of you is, that you will not turn nun.’ With these
    words, he wept through affection. I&nbsp;said to him, ‘If you wish
    to content me, I&nbsp;do not want any other favor from you, except
    that you would put me in a convent; all my desires are there.
    Content me in this, and you will content me in everything
    else, and depend upon it, it will be a source of comfort to
    yourself afterwards.’”</p>
  <p>
    Her father, finding all his efforts unsuccessful, sent her to live
    with her uncle, whom he secretly instructed to use all his
    influence and artifice to dissuade her from her design. Here she
    had an illness, for which the physicians could discover no remedy;
    until some of her attendants, perceiving that she grew sensibly
    better, whenever they talked of nuns and convents, informed her
    father, who thereupon gave up his opposition to her entreaties,
    and, as soon as he had allowed her to choose the convent in which
    she would be professed, she rose from her bed, and all symptoms of
    sickness immediately disappeared.</p>
  <p>
    She then begged him to allow her to enter the rigorous convent of
    capuchine nuns at Città di Castello, and was conducted by her
    uncle to the bishop of the diocese, to obtain his permission. He
    told them that all the places in the convent were filled up, and
    they left him, to return home. But Ursula besought her uncle to
    return with her to his presence, where, falling on her knees, she
    prayed him in such earnest accents to comfort her by granting her
    request, that he was inclined to make an exception in her favor.
    He put several questions to her, and asked her amongst the rest,
    if she knew Latin. Her uncle at once replied in the negative, but
    Ursula, full of confidence in God’s aid, took up the breviary, and
    read it with the most correct pronunciation; and although she had
    never studied Latin, she was able, during the rest of her life, to
    quote the texts of Scripture with perfect aptness and propriety.
    The bishop accordingly granted her leave to enter the convent,
    into which she was admitted on the 17th of July, 1677, and was
    vested on the Feast of SS. Simon and Jude, in the same year. The
    devil sought to weaken her love of her new state, by representing
    it as one leading to despair: at one time, he filled her
    imagination with the remembrance of the many proposals of marriage
    and the young men that she had rejected; at another, he made the
    time of prayer tedious and disgusting to her. “It seems,” she
    says, “as if all hell were let loose against me, but I&nbsp;heeded
    it not. When I&nbsp;felt more than usually agitated by their
    attacks, I&nbsp;went alone into my cell, and there poured out my
    soul in prayer to God, and represented my necessities to him.
    Sometimes I&nbsp;offered up acts of prayer, and besought Him not
    to desert me; and said to him, full of faith, ‘My God, Thou
    knowest that I&nbsp;am Thy spouse, grant, therefore, that
    I&nbsp;may never be separated from Thee. Now, for ever,
    I&nbsp;place myself in Thy hands; I&nbsp;am ready for whatever
    Thou shalt command. I&nbsp;am Thine, I&nbsp;am Thine, that is
    enough.’” God did not fail to strengthen her, by saying to her
    heart, “Fear not, thou art mine. It is my will that thou shouldst
    suffer and combat; fear not.” At her reception, she took the name
    of Veronica, by which we shall henceforth call her.</p>
  <p>
    We pass over the numerous instances of suffering and obedience
    which she gave during her novitiate; at the end of which she was
    admitted to make her profession on All Saints’ day, 1678. Her
    writings contain many allusions to the joy which she derived from
    the recurrence of this day of solemn renunciation of the world and
    dedication of herself to her Heavenly Spouse. The first years she
    passed in the order were distinguished by the most extraordinary
    marks of Divine grace; all of which produced in her, compunction
    and sorrow for her sins, and love of mortification, and the cross
    of Christ. One of her raptures she thus describes: “The first time
    that I&nbsp;had these <i>recollections</i> with a vision, it
    seemed to me that I&nbsp;saw, on a sudden, Our Lord with a heavy
    cross on His shoulders, when He invited me to take a part in that
    precious treasure. This invitation was given by communication
    rather than by words. At that instant I&nbsp;felt a strong desire
    of sufferings, and it seemed that the Lord planted the cross in my
    heart, giving me to understand the value of suffering. This
    understanding I&nbsp;received in the following manner. It appeared
    as if all sorts of torments were represented to me, and, at the
    same moment, I&nbsp;saw them transformed into jewels and precious
    stones, all of which were made in the figure of the cross. During
    this time, I&nbsp;was given to know that God wished pure suffering
    in me; and then the vision disappeared. When I&nbsp;came to
    myself, I&nbsp;felt a violent pain in my head, which has never
    since left me, and so eager was my desire of suffering, that
    I&nbsp;would willingly have faced every torment that can be
    conceived. From that moment I&nbsp;have ever had in
    my mouth these words, ‘The cross and sufferings are jewels and
    joys.’” From this account it may be collected, that, on this
    occasion, Jesus impressed that visible mark of the cross upon her
    heart, which was seen, after her death, by several persons, when
    her body was opened for that purpose.</p>
  <p>
    Veronica was successively appointed to fill every office of the
    community, in all of which she displayed the same wonderful
    examples of virtue, and love of obedience and suffering; and many
    signs of Divine favor proved to her sisters how pleasing her
    actions were to Almighty God. She was appointed Mistress of the
    Novices, in her thirty-fourth year, and continued for twenty-two
    years in that office, until she was chosen abbess, in 1716; and
    even then, so extraordinary had been the efficacy of her prayers,
    and zeal in the discharge of it, that her sisters forced her,
    contrary to the usual order, to retain it during the eleven years
    she was abbess. More than once, to free them from sickness, and
    other inconveniences, she obtained of God, that she might suffer
    in their stead; and some of them were relieved by her, in their
    anxiety and trouble of mind, which had been supernaturally made
    known to her. On one occasion was revealed to her the severe
    judgment which God will make of superiors and directors of
    religious communities, by whose fault any relaxation of fervor
    creeps amongst those committed to their care. On the 9th of
    November, she fell dangerously ill, and during the agony which
    succeeded, was carried in spirit before the throne of the Divine
    Judge. She beheld Christ, with a severe countenance, seated on a
    throne of majesty, surrounded by angels; Our blessed Lady on one
    side, and her patron saints on the other. When her good angel
    presented her to the awful judgment, she expected to be condemned
    to hell,—so severe, she tells us, were the reproaches of the
    Judge, and so unprovided was she with good works; but so earnest
    were the prayers of Mary, and of her holy advocates, that the
    divine countenance of Christ at last grew calm; and, after giving
    her various salutary admonitions, He dismissed her.</p>
  <p>
    On the morning after her agony, she called her novices; and,
    having obtained leave from her confessor to speak to them
    respecting their failings, and her own negligence in correcting
    them, which had been revealed to her during her vision of
    judgment, she whispered to them with such earnestness, that they
    burst into a flood of tears, and, at the end, she said to them,
    “Do not learn of me, who have been the scandal of all in all my
    conduct; for in the observance of the rules, as well as in
    obedience, love and charity, I&nbsp;have been ever proud and
    devoid of humility.” The nuns interrupted her with tears and sobs,
    charging themselves with the fault, in not having followed her
    instructions, but she rejoined, “take heed of little things, for,
    before God, things are very different from what we suppose.”</p>
  <p>
    We must now pass to the sublime novitiate and preparation of
    grace, by which she became, during the last thirty-five years of
    her life, an exact image of Our crucified Lord. In the year 1693,
    she beheld, in a vision, a mysterious chalice or cup, which she
    knew to be the presage of the Divine passion, whereof she was to
    be a perfect copy. This vision was repeated in various forms
    during the following years. At one time, the chalice appeared upon
    a bright cloud, surrounded with glory; at another, without any
    ornament: sometimes the liquor contained in it, boiled and ran
    over in great abundance; at other times, it issued from it, drop
    by drop. Her spirit was ready to quaff it to the bottom, but the
    flesh shuddered and drew back, as did our Lord’s in the garden;
    but she subdued it by severe mortifications. “I&nbsp;must not be
    too confident,” she writes, “because I&nbsp;know that, as yet, it
    is not dead. The spirit I&nbsp;have always found eager and
    desirous of drinking it, and willing to taste of such bitterness,
    in order to fulfil the will of God. At times I&nbsp;felt these
    desires, and I&nbsp;exclaimed: ‘When will the hour come, O&nbsp;my
    God, when Thou wilt allow me to drink of Thy cup? I&nbsp;await Thy
    will, but Thou alone knowest my thirst: I&nbsp;thirst,
    I&nbsp;thirst, but not for comforts, but for bitterness and
    sufferings.’ I&nbsp;felt that I&nbsp;could wait no
    longer. One night, whilst I&nbsp;was in prayer, being quite out of
    myself, it seems that Our Lord appeared to me, and, holding the
    cup in His hand, said: ‘This is for thee, and I&nbsp;present it to
    thee, that thou mayest taste, as much as I&nbsp;have tasted, for
    thy sake, but not yet. Prepare thyself, for thou also shalt taste
    it.’ He then disappeared, leaving the remembrance of that chalice
    so deeply impressed on my mind, that it has ever since remained
    there.”</p>
  <p>
    The anxiety and dread inspired by the constant appearance of this
    cup before her mind’s eyes, threw her into a violent fever, which
    was succeeded by such weakness of body, that her superiors forced
    her to submit to the prescriptions and treatment of physicians,
    which served only to increase her torments.</p>
  <p>
    But the most sensible torment was, the privation of the light of
    God. “All these sufferings were a mere nothing in comparison with
    what I&nbsp;experienced in myself, deserted, abandoned in blackest
    darkness, at such a distance from God, that I&nbsp;could not even
    breathe nor sigh to God.... O,&nbsp;intolerable agony of the soul!
    to see herself stript of every support, and utterly separated to a
    distance from its Sovereign Good. She sighs, but is not heard; she
    calls her Spouse, but He comes not; she seeks Him, but he flies
    still farther off; she prays to Him, but he will not hear.... My
    soul was in such torment, that the agony of death cannot,
    I&nbsp;think, be more bitter. I&nbsp;had no relief, save in seeing
    the cup approach nearer and nearer.... God be praised! for His
    love, all is little. Welcome the naked cross, welcome pure
    suffering. I&nbsp;am ready for all things to give delight to my
    Lord, and to fulfil His divine will.”</p>
  <p>
    God recompensed her readiness to drink the chalice of sufferings,
    by making her a partaker of the torments of His passion. On the
    fourth of April, 1694, as near as can be ascertained, He appeared
    to her, and presented her with His crown of thorns. In obedience
    to her confessor, she thus describes her vision. “On the fourth of
    April, whilst I&nbsp;was in prayer during the night, I&nbsp;fell
    into a recollection, and in it had an intellectual vision, wherein
    Our Lord appeared to me, with a large crown of thorns upon His
    head. Immediately I&nbsp;cried out, ‘My spouse, give me a part of
    these thorns, I&nbsp;deserve them, not Thou, my Sovereign Good!’
    I&nbsp;heard him reply, ‘I&nbsp;am now come to crown thee, my
    beloved;’ and then He took the crown off his head, and placed it
    upon mine. The pain I&nbsp;suffered, at that instant, was so
    excessive, that I&nbsp;have never, as far as I&nbsp;can
    understand, suffered anything like it. But it seemed to me that
    such suffering was a great joy to me; I&nbsp;felt as if
    I&nbsp;should die, if I&nbsp;had not some torment to undergo.”</p>
  <p>
    Finding herself unable to go through her ordinary duties, and
    being anxious, at the same time, to conceal these divine favors
    from her companions, she prayed to God,—“My God, I&nbsp;beseech
    Thee, if it be Thy will, to give me strength to perform the work
    and other duties prescribed for me, and let these Thy graces never
    be manifest, but always in secret.” We pray the reader to observe
    how exactly all the prayers of Veronica, and the effects produced
    in her soul, are conformable to the rules whereby
    Benedict&nbsp;XIV. teaches us to judge of the truth or falsehood
    of such supernatural favors as she received. They are always
    communicated during prayer; they excite in her a more ardent
    desire of undergoing still greater torments for the sake of God,
    —they lead above all to humility and anxiety to hide them from the
    eyes of the world. Let us now see how another of his criterions
    corresponds with the reality of her visions and other graces: we
    mean how they inflamed her with burning charity and zeal for the
    glory of God, and the conversion of sinners. “This pain (of the
    crown of thorns) inspired me with such compassion for sinners,
    that, offering to the Eternal Father all the sufferings of Jesus,
    and all His merits with those of Our Lady for the conversion of
    sinners,<a id="c9_5c"> </a>I&nbsp;prayed more earnestly than ever
    for sufferings, begging Him to send me more torments. At that
    instant, I&nbsp;felt a fresh renewal of the crown of thorns, not
    only round my head, as usual, but all over it; and, for several
    hours, I&nbsp;remained rejoicing amid thousands of torments. It is
    only a few days since I&nbsp;had this renewal, and it was
    signified to me, at the same time, that this was a warning that
    I&nbsp;was to spend this Lent in continual suffering. God be
    praised! Everything is little for His sake!”</p>
  <p>
    This crowning was renewed several times during the course of her
    life. Her directors, being informed that it had taken place,
    commissioned Sister Florida Ceoli to observe if there were any
    visible marks of it on her head. She deposed, on oath, as
    follows:—“I&nbsp;visited her, and saw that she had upon her
    forehead something like a circle, tending to a red color.
    Sometimes I&nbsp;have observed upon it certain pimples, about the
    size of a pin-head, in the form of little buttons. At other times
    she had her forehead sprinkled with marks of a purple color all
    round, like the figure of thorns which came down towards the eyes;
    and, in particular, I&nbsp;saw one of these marks, like thorns,
    come down towards the right eye, and even passed quite under it,
    filling it with tears; and I&nbsp;saw that the tears were blood,
    from the veil wherewith she wiped them away; as I&nbsp;have
    frequently told her confessors who enjoined me to watch her.”</p>
  <p>
    But not content with these observations made by her companions,
    and wishing fully to ascertain if such effects proceeded from
    natural or supernatural causes, the bishop of the city caused her
    to be placed under the care of physicians and surgeons; but, after
    they had exhausted all the resources of their art, and applied
    remedies so cruel and so violent that none of the sisterhood would
    assist at them, but left Veronica herself to hold the heated
    instruments for them, they abandoned the attempt; and the bishop
    and her directors were persuaded that He alone, who had imprinted
    such marks of love upon His servant, was capable of curing them,
    and that he had thereby wished to render her more and more
    conformable to Himself.</p>
  <p>
    The sacred Scriptures use the word <i>espousals</i> to denote a
    more intimate union formed between God and the soul by the most
    perfect love. In the book of Canticles the Holy Ghost describes
    the correspondence of a soul with grace, under the figure of two
    spouses, and in the New Testament, Our Lord speaks of the virgins
    whom He admits to His heavenly marriage-feast. This spiritual
    union with certain devout souls God has been pleased to make
    manifest to them by more sensible signs, accompanied by
    formalities like those used in ordinary marriages. Of such we read
    in the life of the ecstatic St.&nbsp;Catharine of Siena. To this
    exalted dignity God was pleased to raise Veronica, as he revealed
    to her, during the crowning with thorns, of which we have already
    spoken.</p>
  <p>
    One of the commands given to Veronica, after her espousals, was
    that she should increase her fasting; and about a year after that
    event, she received a direct injunction from God to fast for three
    whole years upon nothing but bread and water. But Almighty God,
    wishing at the same time to put her obedience to her superiors to
    the test, caused them all to refuse her their permission, without
    which she could not put the Divine command in practice. And,
    although He continued to repeat His command and even to reproach
    her for not fulfilling it; and although her stomach rejected every
    other food but bread, yet her superiors obstinately refused to
    accede to her petition. “I&nbsp;was full of joy,” she says,
    “because in this way I&nbsp;suffered much, but I&nbsp;felt that
    the flesh could bear no more.” At length, after she had undergone
    the severest torments, from the refusal of her superiors, the
    weakness of her body, and her sorrow of mind, at not being able to
    comply with the will of God, from March to September, God was
    pleased to support her by milk miraculously supplied in the same
    manner as is related by the Bollandists of the holy virgins,
    Lidwige, or Lidwina, in Holland, and Geltrude in Belgium.</p>
  <p>
    The most severe trial to which she was exposed, was from
    desolation and sadness of spirit, and from the bitter malice and
    fierce assaults of the devil against her purity, during 1696, the
    year after her mystic espousals.</p>
  <p>
    Under the 17th of October, we read as follows: “Amongst my other
    tribulations came this also. Whilst I&nbsp;was in prayer, there
    came upon me such, and so many evil thoughts of impurity and of
    grievous sins, and they threw me into such anguish, that at one
    time they covered me with perspiration, and at another made me
    freeze, with an internal agony, which confused and disturbed my
    soul. I&nbsp;did not wish to disquiet myself, nor to give myself
    trouble and pain, but I&nbsp;could not help it; I&nbsp;felt myself
    so oppressed and sunk in these filthy thoughts, and my mind so
    completely obscured, that I&nbsp;could do nothing. The demon
    tempted me, and I&nbsp;seemed to hear a dreadful voice, which
    continually repeated, ‘See, these are the fruits of praying for
    sinners. All their sins are crowding upon thy head. Do good now,
    if thou canst.’ As he spoke these words, the devil seemed to make
    merry and rejoice. O&nbsp;God, what torment it gave me! As well as
    I&nbsp;could, I&nbsp;begged of God the salvation of souls, and
    I&nbsp;said, ‘My sovereign good, Spouse of my soul, I&nbsp;do not
    offend Thee in will, and therefore I&nbsp;detest and abhor every
    wicked thought; and now and for ever, I&nbsp;tell Thee, that my
    will does not wish to entertain them. Rather death, and a thousand
    deaths, than that I&nbsp;should ever consent to a single thought
    that can offend Thee.’ As I&nbsp;said this, though with great
    difficulty, the devil tormented me by suggesting worse thoughts
    than ever, and telling me that no hope was left me.
    I&nbsp;replied, ‘Liar that thou art, I&nbsp;will not yield to thy
    falsehoods. Jesus will I&nbsp;love, Jesus will I&nbsp;serve;
    I&nbsp;have no other good but Jesus.’ In this struggle
    I&nbsp;remained for several hours, always with desolation,
    dryness, and temptations. God be blessed for all!” The like
    temptations and assaults, both from her flesh and from the devil,
    are described under December of the same year, but she repeated
    with the glorious martyr St.&nbsp;Cecily, <i>fiat cor meum et
    corpus meum immaculatum ut non confundar</i>, “Let my heart and
    body be immaculate, that I&nbsp;may not be confounded.” On
    Christmas eve she made an incision upon her heart in the form of a
    cross, with a pen-knife. With the blood, which issued from it, she
    wrote a fervent protestation of love, and a dedication of her will
    to her infant Saviour. Four other writings of the same kind, made
    during the course of that and the following year, 1697, all
    breathe the same feelings of consecration of her will to Jesus,
    and especially of ardent charity and zeal for the salvation of her
    neighbors, whose mediatrix she had promised to be. In one of them,
    she writes, “I&nbsp;intend at this moment to confirm all the
    protestations which I&nbsp;have made with my own blood. Lo!
    I&nbsp;am ready to give my life and blood for the conversion of
    sinners, and the confirmation of the Holy Faith. O&nbsp;my God!
    with your heart, with your love, I&nbsp;make this invitation.
    O&nbsp;souls redeemed with the blood of Jesus, I&nbsp;speak to
    you; O&nbsp;sinners, come all to the heart of Jesus, to the
    fountain, to the boundless sea of His love. Come, all of you, men
    and women, come all! leave sin; come to Jesus!” Her loving spouse
    rewarded her constancy and love.</p>
  <p>
    On Good Friday, the 5th of April, 1697, she received those rich
    pledges of love which were vouchsafed to the seraphic
    St.&nbsp;Francis, St.&nbsp;Catharine, and other saints; for Our
    Lord, after having previously foretold these graces, and after
    displaying his mercies in other ways, to her, was pleased to
    imprint upon her hands and feet, the stigmata or wounds of his
    most sacred passion. These wounds were afterwards renewed upon
    several other occasions, and their reality was made known to many
    persons. For the Tribunal of the Holy Office at Rome, having
    received information thereof, ordered the bishop of the city to
    make an inquiry into the truth of the report. He repaired to the
    grate of the convent, with several other ecclesiastics, who
    severally saw the wounds which her blessed Spouse had made. Those
    in the hands and feet, as Florida Ceoli and other sisters attest,
    were on the upper side round, and about the size of a farthing,
    but less on the under side, deep and red when open, and covered
    with a thin cicatrix or crust, when closed. The wound in the left
    side, above the left breast, was between four and five fingers in
    length, and about one finger broad in the middle, growing thinner
    towards the two extremities, exactly like the wound of a lance.
    Veronica was so alarmed at the thought of undergoing these
    examinations so dreadful to her virginal modesty, that she told
    sister Florida Ceoli, in confidence, she should have died of
    confusion, if God had not deprived her of her senses, during them.
    And her profound humility suggested to her to beg earnestly of her
    beloved Saviour to leave her the pain, but hide the marks of these
    wounds from the eyes of the world, as he had done to
    St.&nbsp;Catharine of Siena, and other saints; but he ordered her
    to tell her confessor, that these wounds were to remain, that by
    the rigorous investigations of the Congregation of the Holy
    Office, it might be known that they had been imprinted by His
    divine hand; and that for this purpose, they were to remain
    visible for three years. So in effect it happened; for after three
    years, on the 5th of April, 1700, the wounds closed, but not until
    it had been proved to many that they were indeed the work of
    divine love. But, although they were closed to the eyes of others,
    it is attested by several witnesses, that the pain still
    continued, and that they were renewed after that date upon the
    greater festivals of the church, the feasts of St.&nbsp;Francis
    and of his stigmata, and as often as her superiors commanded. She
    herself mentions their being renewed in 1703, three years after
    their closing; and her confessor, Father Ranier Guelfi, as late as
    holy Saturday, the 19th of April, 1726, having been informed by
    her, that Jesus had renewed her wounds twice upon that same day,
    commanded her to pray that they might be renewed for the third
    time. She obeyed, and after remaining in ecstasy at his feet for
    some time, told him that she had obtained the grace. To his
    astonishment he beheld the wounds open, and blood issuing from
    them. To have additional witnesses, he pretended to disbelieve
    her, and ordered her to show them to two of her companions, who
    both saw them open and covered with blood, as they testify in the
    process. Besides the testimony of these and the many others, both
    ecclesiastics and nuns, who saw these wounds, the reality of their
    existence was proved by the fact that the most diligent endeavors
    of surgeons to cure them served only to inflame them still more.
    But the most undoubted proof is, that she was able in spite of
    them, to live and perform her duties during a space of thirty
    years; especially when we reflect that the physician and surgeon,
    who inspected her body, after her death, agreed that the wound in
    her left side was enough, at any instant, to have caused her
    death, so that they considered her very continuance in life a
    miracle.</p>
  <p>
    Veronica foretold that twenty-four marks would be found engraven
    upon her heart; and, by the order of her confessor, she described
    the exact form and disposition of them, by cutting them out in red
    and white paper; and after her death, they were found to
    correspond in every particular with the account and picture which
    she had made of them. They were as follows:—a Latin cross, with a
    C&nbsp;in the top of the upright piece; the centre of the
    transverse an&nbsp;F; in the right point of the transverse
    a&nbsp;V; and in the left an&nbsp;O. Above the cross was, on one
    side, a crown of thorns; on the left of which was a banner upon a
    staff, which passed transversely over the cross, and the flag of
    the banner was divided into two
    tongues, on the upper of which was a large I, and on the lower an
    <i>m</i> in running hand. At the top of the banner was a flame,
    and, lower down, a hammer, a pair of pincers, a lance, and a reed
    with a sponge represented upon the top. On the right of the cross,
    beginning from above, was a small garment to represent the
    seamless vest of Our Lord, another flame, a chalice, two wounds, a
    column, three nails, a scourge, and seven swords; with the letters
    P.P.V. on other parts of the heart. All these marks were exactly
    described by her upon paper, which being compared with her heart,
    soon after death, were found to agree in every particular. Her
    confessor attests that the meaning of the above letters and
    emblems is:—The seven swords are the seven dolors of Mary; the
    banner, the ensign of her victories over the Devil, the world and
    herself; the two letters, <i>I</i>&nbsp;(<i>J</i>)
    and&nbsp;<i>m</i>, Jesus and Mary; <i>C</i>,&nbsp;Charity;
    <i>F</i>,&nbsp;Faith and Fidelity to God;
    <i>O</i>,&nbsp;Obedience; the two&nbsp;<i>VV</i>, Humility and the
    Will of God (<i>U</i>miltà, and Volontà di Dio), <i>P&nbsp;P</i>,
    Patience and Suffering (<i>P</i>atire); the two flames, the love
    of God and her neighbor.</p>
  <p>
    But we have now reached the point towards which all her
    aspirations were directed; the happy moment when she was to be
    united to that Spouse, towards whom her soul had hastened, as the
    thirsty hart flieth to the fountains of living waters. She
    endured, as she had foretold, in this her last stage of more than
    mortal agony and bitterness, a three-fold purgatory; first, in the
    persecutions and harshness of men, on the part of her physicians,
    and those who attended her, then on the part of the devil, who
    tempted her to despair; and, lastly, from holy obedience; for,
    although she had so fervently longed for the moment wherein she
    was to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, it had been made known
    to her that she was not to die, without the command of her
    confessor; that so the obedience, which had been so perfect in
    life, might be crowned even on earth, by opening for her the gate
    of heavenly bliss. And, as in her burning charity, and her eager
    desire and incomparable endurance of suffering, as well as in the
    pains of His blessed passion, she had so closely copied our Lord,
    so it pleased Him to make the days of her last illness of the same
    number as the years of His sojourn in this vale of tears; and on
    the thirty-third day, to close her life by an agony of three
    hours, like to his own upon the cross. As she lay motionless and
    tranquil, her confessor, perceiving that her life was drawing near
    its term, said, “Be glad of heart, sister Veronica, what you have
    so much longed for, is near at hand.” As she heard these words,
    she gave a sign of her unspeakable joy, and then turned and
    fastened her eyes upon him. He began to recite the “Recommendation
    of a Departing Soul,” and suggest acts of virtue and resignation,
    without being able to understand why she looked at him with so
    fixed an eye. At length, enlightened by Almighty God, he
    recollected that she had told him that she would not wish to die,
    save with the leave of her superiors, and through holy obedience,
    which permission she now craved by the fixed and earnest eye
    wherewith she regarded him. Animated, therefore, with a lively
    faith in God, he approached her and said, “Sister Veronica, since
    it is the will of God that you should now go to enjoy Him, and
    since it is the pleasure of His Divine Majesty, that for your
    departure, the leave of His minister should also be
    granted,—I&nbsp;now give it to you.” Scarcely were these words
    uttered, than she bent her eyes in token of submission; then
    turning towards her spiritual daughters, as if to give them her
    last blessing, she bowed her head, and yielded up her soul, in the
    peace of the Lord, on Friday, the 9th of July, 1727, in the
    sixty-seventh year of her age, and the fiftieth of her religious
    profession.</p>
  <p>
    Of her perfection in the discharge of all the duties of her state
    of life,—of her faith, hope, and love of God and her neighbor,—of
    her meekness and humility, which she practised in the most heroic
    degree,—it is unnecessary here to say more, than that in them she
    was an exact copy of that virtue which her loving Spouse displayed
    in His life amongst men. Even upon earth, her sanctity was made
    manifest by the accomplishment of the events which she had
    foretold, and by the miracles that she performed; and since her
    death, the most wonderful favors have been obtained by her
    intercession. From the many that are recorded in the acts of her
    beatification, we select only two. The first is that of her
    confidential companion and friend, sister Mary Magdalen Boscaini,
    who, in the course of the years 1729-30, was attacked by such a
    complication of disorders, that she could neither taste food, nor
    lie down, without considerable difficulty; she was subject to
    frequent fainting-fits and vomitings, and remained in this state
    for eleven months, being declared by her physicians to have
    reached an advanced stage of consumption. At last, on the vigil of
    St.&nbsp;Matthias, in 1730, eleven months since the beginning of
    her illness, her confessor exhorted her to place a firm reliance
    upon Veronica, under whom she had passed her novitiate; and when
    he had excited her confidence and hope, he gave her to drink some
    water, in which a relic of the saint had been. She drank it, and
    instantly sprang out of bed, and ran to see one of her sisters,
    who was also sick; and afterwards to meet the physician at the
    door, who was coming to make his usual visit. He carefully
    examined her; and, after feeling her pulse, pronounced it to be a
    miracle, as the effect proved, for she lived twelve years
    longer,—when a second illness attacked her, from which she
    recovered, in like manner, by the intercession of Veronica; and so
    lived for twenty-two years more, dying in 1765. The second miracle
    was the sudden and perfect cure of Maria Pacciarini, of an
    arthritic rheumatism of long duration; from which she
    instantaneously and perfectly recovered, by the intercession of
    Veronica.</p>
  <p>
    Veronica was beatified by Pius&nbsp;VII., in 1804, the Cardinal
    Duke of York being the reporter of the Cause to the Congregation
    of Rites. She was solemnly canonized by Gregory&nbsp;XVI., on
    Trinity Sunday, 26th May, 1839.</p>
  <p>
    “There are often found, in the lives of those who enjoy a
    reputation for sanctity, certain extraordinary marks, which the
    profane rashly and foolishly scoff at, as empty and dreamy
    visions: and the inexperienced multitude, on the other hand,
    receives as irrefragable proofs of virtue: nor are those wanting,
    who, misled by a deceitful semblance of prudence and caution,
    blindly pronounce them the result of artifice and cunning. The
    prudent man avoids all these extremes; and, whilst he silently
    admires things beyond the reach of ordinary understandings,
    inquires into their causes; but, still, not from such effects
    does he decide upon the virtues of those in whom they are
    conspicuous,<a id="c9_5d"> </a>but looks chiefly to the conduct
    and actions they have produced in them, that from the fruits, as
    our Divine Master teacheth, the quality of the tree may be
    known.”<a

    THE SEVEN BROTHERS,&nbsp;MARTYRS, AND

    p.&nbsp;5.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    IN THE SECOND CENTURY.</p>
  <p>
    The illustrious martyrdom of these saints has been justly
    celebrated by the holy fathers.<a id="c10_1a"> </a>It happened at
    Rome under the emperor Antoninus, that is, according to several
    ancient copies of the acts, Antoninus Pius.<a
      href="#fn_90"
      class="anchor">90</a>
    The seven brothers were the sons of St.&nbsp;Felicitas, a noble
    pious Christian widow in Rome, who brought them up in the most
    perfect sentiments and practice of heroic virtue.<a id="c10_1b">
    </a>After the death of her husband she served God in a state of
    continency<a
      href="#fn_91"
      class="anchor">91</a>
    and employed herself wholly in prayer, fasting, and works of
    charity. By the public and edifying example of this lady and her
    whole family, many idolators were moved to renounce the worship of
    their false gods, and to embrace the faith of Christ, which
    Christians were likewise encouraged by so illustrious a pattern
    openly to profess. This raised the spleen of the heathenish
    priests, who complained to the emperor Antoninus that the boldness
    with which Felicitas publicly practised the Christian religion,
    drew many from the worship of the immortal gods who were the
    guardians and protectors of the empire, and that it was a
    continual insult on them; who, on that account, were extremely
    offended and angry with the city and whole state. They added, that
    in order to appease them, it was necessary to compel this lady and
    her children to sacrifice to them. Antoninus being himself
    superstitious was prevailed upon by this remonstrance to send an
    order to Publius the prefect of Rome, to take care that the
    priests should be satisfied, and the gods appeased in this matter.
    Publius caused the mother and her sons to be apprehended and
    brought before him. When this was done he took Felicitas aside,
    and used the strongest inducements to bring her freely to
    sacrifice to the gods, that he might not be obliged to proceed
    with severity against her and her sons; but she returned him this
    answer: “Do not think to frighten me by threats, or to win me by
    fair speeches. The spirit of God within me will not suffer me to
    be overcome by Satan, and will make me victorious over all your
    assaults.” Publius said in a great rage: “Unhappy woman, is it
    possible you should think death so desirable as not to permit even
    your children to live, but force me to destroy them by the most
    cruel torments?” “My children,” said she, “will live eternally
    with Christ if they are faithful to him; but must expect eternal
    death if they sacrifice to idols.” The next day the prefect,
    sitting in the square of Mars before his temple, sent for
    Felicitas and her sons, and addressing his speech to her, said:
    “Take pity of your children, Felicitas; they are in the bloom of
    youth, and may aspire to the greatest honors and preferments.” The
    holy mother answered: “Your pity is really impiety, and the
    compassion to which you exhort me would make me the most cruel of
    mothers.” Then turning herself towards her children, she said to
    them, “My sons, look up to heaven where Jesus Christ with his
    saints expects you. Be faithful in his love, and fight
    courageously for your souls.” Publius being exasperated at this
    behavior, commanded her to be cruelly buffeted, saying: “You are
    insolent indeed, to give them such advice as this in my presence,
    in contempt of the orders of our princes.”</p>
  <p>
    The judge then called the children to him one after another, and
    used many artful speeches, mingling promises with threats to
    induce them to adore the gods. Januarius, the eldest, experienced
    his assaults the first, but resolutely answered him: “You advise
    me to do a thing that is very foolish, and contrary to all reason;
    but I&nbsp;confide in my Lord Jesus Christ, that he will preserve
    me from such an impiety.” Publius ordered him to be stripped and
    cruelly scourged, after which he sent him back to prison. Felix,
    the second brother, was called next, and commanded to sacrifice.
    But the generous youth replied, “There is one only God. To him we
    offer the sacrifice of our hearts. We will never forsake the love
    which we owe to Jesus Christ. Employ all your artifices; exhaust
    all inventions of cruelty; you will never be able to overcome our
    faith.” The other brothers made their answers separately, that
    they feared not a passing death, but everlasting torments; and
    that having before their eyes the immortal recompenses of the
    just, they despised the threats of men.<a id="c10_1c">
    </a>Martialis, who spoke last, said: “All who do not confess
    Christ to be the true God, shall be cast into eternal flames.”<a
      href="#fn_92"
      class="anchor">92</a>
    The brothers, after being whipped, were remanded to prison, and
    the prefect, despairing to be able ever to overcome their
    resolution, laid the whole process before the emperor. Antoninus
    having read the interrogatory, gave an order that they should be
    sent to different judges, and be condemned to different deaths.
    Januarius was scourged to death with whips loaded with plummets of
    lead. The two next, Felix and Philip, were beaten with clubs till
    they expired. Sylvanus, the fourth, was thrown headlong down a
    steep precipice. The three youngest, Alexander, Vitalis, and
    Martialis, were beheaded, and the same sentence was executed upon
    the mother four months after.<a id="c10_1d">
    </a>St.&nbsp;Felicitas is commemorated in the Roman Martyrology on
    the 23d of November; the sons on the 10th of July, on which day
    their festival is marked in the old Roman Calendar, published by
    Bucherius.<a
      href="#fn_93"

  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great delivered his third homily on the
    Gospels, on the festival of St.&nbsp;Felicitas, in the church
    built over her tomb on the Salarian road. In this discourse he
    says, that this saint “having seven children was as much afraid of
    leaving them behind her on earth, as other mothers are of
    surviving theirs. She was more than a martyr, for seeing her seven
    dear children martyred before her eyes, she was in some sort a
    martyr in each of them. She was the eighth in the order of time,
    but was from the first to the last in pain, and began her
    martyrdom in the eldest, which she only finished in her own death.
    She received a crown not only for herself, but likewise for all
    her children. Seeing them in torments she remained constant,
    feeling their pains by nature as their mother, but rejoicing for
    them in her heart by hope.” The same father takes notice how weak
    faith is in us: in her it was victorious over flesh and blood; but
    in us is not able to check the sallies of our passions, or wean
    our hearts from a wicked and deceitful world. “Let us be covered
    with shame and confusion,” says he, “that we should fall so far
    short of the virtue of this martyr, and should suffer our passions
    still to triumph over faith in our hearts. Often one word spoken
    against us disturbs our minds; at the least blast of contradiction
    we are discouraged or provoked; but neither torments nor death
    were able to shake her courageous soul. We weep without ceasing
    when God requires of us the children he hath lent us; and she
    bewailed her children when they did not die for Christ, and
    rejoiced when she saw them die.” What afflictions do parents daily
    meet with from the disorders into which their children fall
    through their own bad example or neglect! Let them imitate the
    earnestness of St.&nbsp;Felicitas in forming to perfect virtue the
    tender souls which God hath committed to their charge, and with
    this saint they will have the greatest of all comforts in them;
    and will by his grace count as many saints in their family as they
    are blessed with children.</p>

    SAINTS RUFINA AND SECUNDA, VIRGINS,&nbsp;MM.</h3>
  <p>
    They were sisters, and the daughters of one Asterius, a man of a
    senatorian family in Rome. Their father promised them in marriage,
    the first to Armentarius, and the second to Verinus, who were then
    both Christians, but afterward apostatized from the faith when the
    storm raised by Valerian and Gallien in 257, fell upon the Church.
    The two virgins resisted their solicitations to imitate their
    impiety, and fled out of Rome; but were overtaken, brought back,
    and after other torments condemned by Junius Donatus, prefect of
    Rome, to lose their heads. They were conducted twelve miles out of
    Rome, executed in a forest on the Aurelian Way, and buried in the
    same place. It was then called the Black Forest, Sylva Nigra, but
    from these martyrs this name was changed into that of Sylva Candia
    or the White Forest. A&nbsp;chapel was built over their tomb,
    which pope Damasus demolished, erecting a large church in its
    room. A&nbsp;town rose in the same place, which was called Sylva
    Candia, and made an episcopal see. But the city being destroyed by
    barbarians in the twelfth century, the bishopric was united by
    Calixtus&nbsp;II. to that of Porto, and the relics of the saints
    were translated at the same time, in the year 1120, to the Lateran
    basilic, where they are kept near the baptistery of Constantine.

    This eminent saint, and glorious doctor of the Syriac church, was
    a native of Nisibis, in Mesopotamia, which country was then
    subject to the eastern empire.<a
      href="#fn_94"
      class="anchor">94</a>
    He had a genius rich by nature, which he cultivated with
    indefatigable application; though after laying a foundation of
    the sciences, he confined himself to sacred studies. In his youth
    entering the world, he became soon apprised of its dangers. He saw
    that in it only ambition, vanity, and voluptuousness reign; that
    men here usually live in a hurry and a crowd, without finding
    leisure to look into themselves, or to study that great science
    which ought to be their only affair. He trembled at the sight of
    its vices, and the slippery path of its pleasures, which, though
    they seem agreeable at first, yet when tasted are nothing but
    bitterness and mortal poison, and whilst they flatter the senses,
    destroy the soul; and he thought it the safer part to conquer by
    flight, or at least, with the Baptist, to prepare and strengthen
    himself in retirement, that he might afterward be the better able
    to stand his ground in the field. He accordingly chose the highest
    mountains for his abode, sheltering himself in a cave in the
    winter, and the rest of the year living in the woods, continually
    exposed to the open air; and knowing that our greatest conquest is
    to subdue ourselves, in order to facilitate this important
    victory, he joined to assiduous prayer the practice of great
    austerities. He lived only on wild roots and herbs, which he ate
    raw, and had no other garments than a tunic and cloak, both made
    of goat’s hair very coarse. Notwithstanding his desire to live
    unknown to men, yet he was discovered, and many were not afraid to
    climb the rugged rocks that they might recommend themselves to his
    prayers, and receive the comfort of his spiritual advice. He was
    favored with the gifts of prophecy and miracles in an uncommon
    measure, of which he gave several proofs in a journey he took into
    Persia to visit the new churches that were planting there, and
    strengthen the young converts laboring under grievous
    persecutions. His presence fortified them in their good
    resolutions, and inspired them with that spirit of martyrdom which
    afterwards showed itself in their glorious triumphs. He converted
    many idolaters, and wrought several miracles in that country. He
    suffered torments for the faith in the persecution continued by
    Maximinus&nbsp;II. for Gennadius places him in the number of
    confessors under that tyrant; and Nicephorus names him among the
    holy bishops in the council of Nice, who bore the glorious marks
    of their sufferings for Christ. His personal merit and great
    reputation occasioned his promotion to the see of Nisibis; but
    here he still followed the same course of life he had inured
    himself to on the mountains, to his fasts and austerities adding
    the care of the poor, the correction of sinners, and all the other
    toils and hardships of episcopacy. Such was his charity for the
    poor, that he seemed to possess nothing but for their relief. In
    the acts of St.&nbsp;Miles and his companions, Persian martyrs, it
    is related that St.&nbsp;James built at Nisibis a very stately
    church. St.&nbsp;Miles coming to that city was astonished at the
    majesty of the edifice, and having made some stay there with
    St.&nbsp;James, returned to Adiab, whence he sent the holy bishop
    a present of a great quantity of silk for the ornaments of his
    church.</p>
  <p id="c11_1b">
    Theodoret relates<a
      href="#fn_95"
      class="anchor">95</a>
    of him that one day as he was travelling, he was accosted by a
    gang of beggars who had concerted a plot whereby to impose upon
    the servant of God, with the view of extorting money from him on
    pretence to bury their companion, who lay stretched on the ground
    as if he had been dead. The holy man gave them what they asked,
    and “offering up supplications to God as for a soul departed, he
    prayed that his divine majesty would pardon him the sins he had
    committed whilst he lived, and that he would admit him into the
    company of the saints,” says Theodoret. As soon as the saint was
    gone by, his companions calling upon him to rise and take his
    share of the booty, were strangely surprised to find him really
    dead. Seized with sudden fear and grief, they shrieked in the
    utmost consternation, and immediately ran after the man of God,
    cast themselves at his feet, confessed the cheat, begged
    forgiveness, and by entreaties and mournful looks pleaded for
    pity, and besought him by his prayers to restore their unhappy
    companion to life, which the saint performed, as this grave author
    assures us. When the heresy of Arius was set abroach, and began to
    infect many churches, St.&nbsp;James strenuously exerted himself
    in defending his church from the contagion, and labored to crush
    the growing evil. He assisted at the council of Nice in 325, as
    Theodoret and Gennadius testify; likewise at the council of
    Antioch held under St.&nbsp;Eustathius, about the year 326. Being
    at Constantinople in 336, when Constantine commanded
    St.&nbsp;Alexander, the holy bishop of that city, to leave his see
    in case he persisted to refuse admitting to communion Arius, who
    had imposed on that prince by an hypocritical confession of
    faith;<a id="c11_1c"> </a>St.&nbsp;James exhorted the people to
    have recourse to God by fasting and prayer during seven days; and
    on the eighth day, which was the very Sunday on which Arius was to
    have been admitted, the unhappy man was found dead in a privy into
    which he had stepped to ease nature.<a

  <p id="c11_1d">
    The most famous miracle of our Thaumaturgus was that by which he
    protected the city of Nisibis from the barbarians, as is related
    by Theodoret both in his religious and ecclesiastical history; by
    Theophanes, the Alexandrian Chronicle, and even by Philostorgius
    himself,<a
      href="#fn_97"
      class="anchor">97</a>
    who was a rank Arian, cannot be suspected of being too favorable
    to St.&nbsp;James. Sapor&nbsp;II. the haughty king of Persia,
    twice besieged Nisibis with the whole strength of his empire,
    whilst our saint was bishop; and the city was every time
    miraculously protected by the prayers of St.&nbsp;James. Of these
    sieges the first was laid soon after the death of Constantine the
    Great, which happened on the 22nd of May, in 337, after that
    prince had reigned thirty-nine years, nine months, and
    twenty-seven days. His valor had kept the barbarians in awe. But
    upon his demise Sapor came, and in 338 sat down before Nisibis
    with a prodigious army of foot, horse, elephants, and all sorts of
    warlike engines.<a id="c11_1e"> </a>But after continuing the siege
    sixty-three days, he was compelled shamefully to raise it, and
    return into Persia; and his army, harassed by the enemy in its
    march, and exhausted by fatigues, was at length destroyed by
    famine and epidemical diseases.<a
      href="#fn_98"
      class="anchor">98</a>
    The emperor Constantius, when the Persians again invaded the
    territories of the Romans in 348, by his pusillanimity and
    misconduct gave them a great superiority in the field. And
    Cosroës, elated with success, and enriched by the plunder of many
    provinces, ventured a second time with an army still much stronger
    than before to lay siege to Nisibis in 350. His troops having
    seized all the avenues, and made their approaches with a fury
    beyond example, he first endeavored to make a breach in the walls
    by battering rams and mines, but all to no purpose. At length,
    after seventy days’ labor, he caused a dam to be raised at a
    considerable distance from the city, thereby to stop the river
    Mygdon, which ran through it; this he ordered to be broken down
    when the water was at its full height; so that the violence with
    which it beat against the wall of the city made a wide breach in
    it. At this the Persians rent the air with loud shouts of joy, but
    deferred the assault till the next day, that the waters might be
    first carried off, they not being able to make their approaches by
    reason of the inundation. When they came up to the breach they
    were strangely surprised to find another wall which the
    inhabitants had raised behind the former with an astonishing
    expedition, being encouraged by St.&nbsp;James, who remained
    himself all the time in the church at his prayers, by which he
    conquered, like Moses on the mountain. Sapor marching up to the
    breach in person, fancied he saw a man in royal apparel on the
    wall, whose purple and diadem cast an uncommon brightness. This
    person he believed was the Roman emperor Constantius, and
    threatened to put to death those who had told him the emperor was
    at Antioch. But upon their giving him fresh assurances that
    Constantius was really there, and convinced that heaven fought for
    the Romans, he threw up a javelin into the air, out of impotent
    revenge because heaven seemed to take part against him. Then
    St.&nbsp;Ephrem, deacon of Edessa and St.&nbsp;James’s disciple,
    being present, entreated him to go upon the walls to take a view
    of the Persians, and pray to God that he would defeat the infidel
    army. The bishop would not pray for the destruction of any one,
    but he implored the divine mercy that the city might be delivered
    from the calamities of so long a siege. Afterwards, going to the
    top of a high tower, and turning his face towards the enemy, and
    seeing the prodigious multitude of men and beasts which covered
    the whole country, he said: “Lord, thou art able by the weakest
    means to humble the pride of thy enemies; defeat these multitudes
    by an army of gnats.”<a id="c11_1f"> </a>God heard the humble
    prayers of his servant, as he had done that of Moses against the
    Egyptians, and as he had by the like means vanquished the enemies
    of his people when he conducted them out of Egypt.<a
      href="#fn_99"
      class="anchor">99</a>
    <a id="c11_1g"> </a>For scarce had the saint spoken these words,
    when whole clouds of gnats and flies came pouring down upon the
    Persians, got into the elephants’ trunks, and the horses’ ears and
    nostrils, which made them chafe and foam, throw their riders, and
    put the whole army into confusion and disorder.<a
      href="#fn_100"
      class="anchor">100</a>
    A&nbsp;famine and pestilence which followed, carried off a great
    part of the army; and Sapor, after lying above three months before
    the place, set fire to all his own engines of war, and was forced
    to abandon the siege and return home with the loss of twenty
    thousand men.<a id="c11_1h"> </a>Sapor received a third foil under
    the walls of Nisibis, in 359, upon which he turned his arms
    against Amidus, took that strong city, and put the garrison and
    the greatest part of the inhabitants to the sword.<a
      href="#fn_101"
      class="anchor">101</a>
    The citizens of Nisibis attributed their preservation to the
    intercession of their glorious patron, St.&nbsp;James, though he
    seems to have been translated to glory before this last siege.<a
    id="c11_1i"> </a>Gennadius says he died in the reign of
    Constantius, whose death happened in 361.<a
      href="#fn_102"
      class="anchor">102</a>
    That of St.&nbsp;James is placed by most moderns in 350, soon
    after the second siege of Nisibis. Gennadius informs us, that out
    of a pious confidence that the saint’s earthly remains would be a
    pledge of his intercession with God for the protection of the city
    against the barbarians, by an order of the emperor Constantius,
    though an Arian, pursuant to an express injunction of his father
    Constantine the Great, notwithstanding the severe laws to the
    contrary then in force, the body of St.&nbsp;James was buried
    within the walls of the city. Julian, the Apostate, in 361,
    envying the saint this distinguished privilege, commanded these
    sacred remains to be removed without the city. Soon after, upon
    his death the emperor Jovian, in 363, in order to purchase peace
    of the Persians, was obliged to yield up to them Nisibis, with the
    five Roman provinces situated on the Tigris, and great part of
    Mesopotamia. But the inhabitants of Nisibis who were compelled by
    Jovian to remove before he delivered up the city, carried with
    them the sacred relics of this saint, which, according to the
    Menology of the Armenians at Venice, were brought to
    Constantinople about the year 970. His name is famous both in the
    Eastern and Western Martyrologies. His festival is kept by the
    Latins on the 15th of July, by the Greeks on the 13th of January
    and the 31st of October, by the Syrians on the 18th of January,
    and by the Armenians on a Saturday in the month of December. The
    last honor him with no less solemnity than the Assyrians, and
    observe before his feast a fast of five days with the same
    severity with that of Lent.<a id="c11_1j"> </a>In his office they
    sing the long devout Armenian hymns, which were compiled in his
    honor by Saint Nierses, patriarch of Armenia, the fourth of that
    name, surnamed of Ghelaia, who strenuously defended the union with
    the Latin church against the Greek emperor, Michael Commenus, in
    the twelfth century, and is honored by the orthodox Armenians
    among the saints.<a

  <p>
    St.&nbsp;James’s learning and writings have procured him a rank

    and the Armenians honor him as one of the principal doctors of
    their national church.<a id="c11_1k"> </a>For though

    at the request of a holy bishop of that nation called Gregory,

    himself the happiness of paying St.&nbsp;James a visit, and
    passing some time with him, in order to improve himself more
    perfectly by his lessons in the knowledge and practice of true
    virtue: in the mean time he earnestly conjures him to favor him
    with some short instructions, and teach him what is the true
    foundation of a spiritual life of faith, by what means the edifice
    is to be raised in our souls, and by what good works, by what

  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 707.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Hidulph, or Hildulph, was born at Ratisbon in Bavaria, of
    one of the most illustrious families in the country, and renounced
    great temporal possessions in his youth to consecrate himself to
    God in an ecclesiastical state,<a id="c11_2a"> </a>which he
    embraced with his brother St.&nbsp;Erard, who was advanced to the
    episcopal see at Ratisbon, was buried in Moyen-Moutier, and is
    honored among the saints on the 8th of January.<a
      href="#fn_111"
      class="anchor">111</a>
    Hidulph was consecrated archbishop of Triers, and discharged for
    some time all the duties of a vigilant and zealous pastor. The
    monastery of St.&nbsp;Maximin had been founded in the fourth
    century, and doubtless observed the discipline of the oriental
    monks. Hidulph introduced into it the Benedictin Order about the
    year 665, and so much augmented it in revenues and settled in it
    so perfect a spirit of monastic virtue, that it was the admiration
    of that age, and is to this day one of the most flourishing abbeys
    in Germany.</p>
  <p>
    Hidulph was much taken with the charms of holy retirement, with
    the happy security and liberty of that state, its exercises of
    humility, penance, and prayer, and the liberty which it affords of
    living disengaged from worldly attachments and distractions, in a
    continual application to heavenly things. He was also strongly
    affected by the example and conversation of many divine men who
    then adorned the Church, and maintained in it the true spirit of
    Christ, by the odor of sanctity which their angelic minds and
    deportment spread, and who were raised to this heroic virtue by
    the exercises of a monastic life.<a id="c11_2b"> </a>The
    obligations of his own charge (which he could not abandon unless
    his reasons for resigning it were such as to be approved of by a
    superior authority, as that of a primate, and rather of the pope
    as patriarch of the West) withheld him some time, but at length he
    found means to resign his see to St.&nbsp;Veomade, abbot of
    St.&nbsp;Maximin’s, and hid himself in that monastery.<a
      href="#fn_112"
      class="anchor">112</a>
    But finding it impossible to live in the obscurity which he
    sought, in the midst of his own diocess, he retired secretly
    amidst the mountains of Voge, on the confines of Lorrain, and
    settled in a small hermitage on the spot which the monks of
    Senones and Estival gave him, and on which he soon after, about
    the year 676, built the monastery of Moyen-Moutier. This name was
    given it from its situation between the abbeys of Senones to the
    east, of Estival to the west, of Bodon-Moutier to the north, and
    to the south that of Jointures, now the collegiate church of
    canons, and the town of St.&nbsp;Die. Three hundred monks served
    God under his direction; for, besides those who composed the
    monastery of Moyen-Moutier, at the request of his friend
    St.&nbsp;Die, upon his death-bed, and of his community, he took
    upon him also the charge of that abbey, and many lived under his
    conduct in separate cells. St.&nbsp;Hidulph governed his own
    monastery above thirty years, though for some time, whilst he was
    obliged to reside at St.&nbsp;Die’s, he appointed a vicar in his
    room at Moyen-Moutier. He returned thither before his death, which
    happened in 707, or, according to others, in 713. His relics are
    kept in a silver shrine in this monastery, which at present bears
    his name, and in union with that of St.&nbsp;Vannes, began the
    reformation of the Benedictin Order, which is so famous in
    Lorrain, and in France. Saint Hidulph’s name is not inserted in
    the Roman Martyrology, but is famous in German, French, and
    Benedictin Calendars.</p>

    The sanctity of those ancient monks who, by the exercises of
    humility and holy solitude, attained to so wonderful a victory
    over their passions, so sublime a degree of virtue, and so
    heavenly a temper as to have seemed rather angels than men, was
    the admiration even of infidels, and the edification of all those
    who had the happiness of enjoying their conversation.<a
    id="c11_2c"> </a>“For my part,” said Saint Sulpicius Severus, or
    his friend Posthumianus,<a
      href="#fn_113"
      class="anchor">113</a>
    “so long as I&nbsp;shall keep alive and in my senses, I&nbsp;shall
    ever celebrate the monks of Egypt, praise the anchorets, and
    admire the hermits.”<a id="c11_2d"> </a>Of the same another
    ancient eye-witness says,<a
      href="#fn_114"
      class="anchor">114</a>
    “There have I&nbsp;seen many fathers leading an angelic life, and
    walking after the example of Jesus.” The more happy and the more
    perfect a religious state is, the greater ought to be the
    watchfulness and the fervor of those who are engaged in it not to
    fall short of their obligations, and lose the precious graces of
    their vocation.</p>
  <p>
    Persons in the world are usually inclined to show no indulgence
    for the least failings which they observe in religious persons.
    How much soever the reformation and perfect sanctification of the
    more illustrious portion of the flock of Christ be to be desired
    and prayed for by all, and promoted by the chief pastors, these
    severe censors would better employ their zeal in looking into, and
    reforming their own hearts. They must never forget that all
    Christians, by their baptismal engagements and the sacred law of
    the gospel which they profess, are bound to sanctify their souls,
    and to serve God in the perfect sentiments and practice of all
    virtues. If in this degenerate age many religious establishments
    stand in need of a spur or some reformation, we may believe an
    enemy “that there is no class or condition of Christians in
    general which does not want it still much more.”</p>

    when, according to Tillemont, in the fourth year of the reign of
    the latter he succeeded St.&nbsp;Hyginus in the papacy in 142. He
    condemned the heresiarch Valentinus, and rejected Marcion, who
    came from Pontus to Rome after the death of Hyginus, as we have
    related elsewhere. The conflicts which St.&nbsp;Pius sustained
    obtained him the title of martyr, which is given him not only in
    Usuard’s Martyrology, but also in many others more ancient; though
    Fontanini, a most judicious and learned critic, strenuously
    maintains, against Tillemont, that he died by the sword. He passed
    to a better life in 157, and was buried at the foot of the Vatican
    hill on the 11th of July. See Tillemont, t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;312,

    ST.&nbsp;JOHN GUALBERT, ABBOT.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FOUNDER OF THE RELIGIOUS ORDER OF VALLIS UMBROSA.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    From his exact life compiled by Blaise Melanisius, general of his
    Order, with the long notes of Cuper the Bollandist. See also two
    other lives of the saint with a long history of his miracles, ib.,
    t.&nbsp;3, Julij, p.&nbsp;311.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1073.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;John Gualbert was born at Florence of rich and noble
    parents, and in his youth was carefully instructed in the
    Christian doctrine and in the elements of the sciences; but
    afterward, by conversing with the world, he imbibed a relish for
    its vanities and follies. While a thirst of worldly pleasure kept
    possession of his desires, and seemed to him innocent, and while
    he thought a certain degree of worldly pride the privilege of his
    birth, he was a stranger to the gospel maxims of penance,
    meekness, and lowliness of heart; and all arguments of virtue lost
    their force upon him. But God was pleased by a remarkable accident
    to open his eyes, and to discover to him his errors, and the
    extent of his obligations. Hugo, his only brother, was murdered by
    a gentleman of the country; and our young nobleman determined to
    revenge the crime by the death of him who had perpetrated it, and
    who seemed out of the reach of the laws. Under the influence of
    his resentment, which was much heightened by the invectives and
    persuasion of his own father Gualbert, he neither listened to the
    voice of reason nor of religion. The motive of revenge is criminal
    if it creeps into the breast even in demanding the just punishment
    of a delinquent; much more if it push men to vindicate their own
    cause themselves by returning injury for injury, and wreaking
    wrongs on those that inflicted them. But passion stifled remorse,
    and John was falsely persuaded that his honor in the world
    required that he should not suffer so flagrant an outrage to pass
    unpunished. It happened that riding with his man home to Florence
    on Good Friday, he met his enemy in so narrow a passage that it
    was impossible for either of them to avoid the other. John seeing
    the murderer, drew his sword, and was going to despatch him. But
    the other, alighting from his horse, fell upon his knees, and with
    his arms across, besought him by the passion of Jesus Christ, who
    suffered on that day, to spare his life. The remembrance of
    Christ, who prayed for his murderers on the cross, exceedingly
    affected the young nobleman; and meekly raising the supplicant
    from the ground with his hand, he said, “I&nbsp;can refuse nothing
    that is asked of me for the sake of Jesus Christ. I&nbsp;not only
    give you your life, but also my friendship for ever. Pray for me
    that God may pardon me my sin.”<a id="c12_1a"> </a>After embracing
    each other they parted, and John went forward on his road till he
    came to the monastery of St.&nbsp;Minias,<a
      href="#fn_116"
      class="anchor">116</a>
    of the holy Order of St.&nbsp;Bennet. Going into the church, he
    offered up his prayers before a great crucifix, begging with many
    tears and extraordinary fervor that God would mercifully grant him
    the pardon of his sins. Whilst he continued his prayer the
    crucifix miraculously bowed its head to him, as it were to give
    him a token how acceptable the sacrifice of his resentment, and
    his sincere repentance were. The divine grace made such deep
    impressions on his heart, that rising from his devotions he cast
    himself at the feet of the abbot, earnestly begging to be admitted
    to the religious habit. The abbot was apprehensive of his father’s
    displeasure; but at length was prevailed upon with much ado to
    allow him to live in the community in his secular habit. After a
    few days John cut off his hair himself, and put on a habit which
    he borrowed. His father, at this news of the step his son had
    taken, hastened to the monastery, and stormed and complained
    dreadfully; till after some time seeing the steadiness of his
    son’s resolution, and hearing his reasons and motives, he was so
    well satisfied, that he gave him his blessing, and exhorted him to
    persevere in his good purposes.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;John devoted himself to the exercises of his new state in
    the most perfect dispositions of a true penitent. He was most
    exact in every religious observance. He subdued his body with much
    fasting and watching; never gave way to idleness, but kept himself
    day and night employed almost in continual prayer. His corporeal
    austerities he animated with a perfect interior spirit of penance,
    or desire of punishing sin in himself, the more powerfully to move
    God to compassion and mercy towards him; and he endeavored by them
    to facilitate the subjection of his passions, which victory he
    completed by a watchfulness over the motions of his own heart, and
    heroic acts of all virtues, especially meekness and humility. But
    assiduous and humble prayer and meditation were the principal
    means by which this wonderful change was effected in all the
    affections of his soul, so that he became entirely a new man.
    Nothing can have so prevalent a power to still the agitation of
    passion in the breast, nothing is so fit to induce a smooth and
    easy flow, and a constant evenness of temper, as a frequent
    application to the throne of grace. This presence of the mind with
    the Lord is an absence from the body, or from the tumult of carnal
    passions. The pure and serene tranquillity that springs up in the
    soul by an intercourse with heaven, shows that here she is nearest
    the centre of her true happiness, where earthly things lose all
    their power of attraction. The very preparation of the heart to
    wait upon God in this solemn exercise is of admirable use to
    remove that corruption which inflames the passions. Especially a
    lively sense of God’s infinite greatness, and of our littleness
    and infirmities, powerfully impressed on our minds by assiduous
    prayer, soon brings us to a conviction that pride is the root of
    all our disorders; and enables us to discover its disguises, and
    to banish it out of our souls. By fidelity and perseverance
    St.&nbsp;John obtained the victory over himself, and became most
    eminent in meekness, humility, silence, obedience, modesty, and
    patience.</p>
  <p>
    When the abbot died our saint was earnestly entreated by the
    greatest part of the monks to accept that dignity; but his consent
    could by no means be extorted. Not long after, he left this house
    with one companion, and went in quest of a closer solitude. He
    paid a visit to the hermitage of Camaldoli; and having edified
    himself with the example of its fervent inhabitants, he proceeded
    further to an agreeable shady valley covered with willow trees,
    commonly called Vallis Umbrosa, in the diocess of Fiesoli, half a
    day’s journey from Florence, in Tuscany. He found in that place
    two devout hermits, with whom he and his companion concerted a
    project to build themselves a small monastery of timber and
    mud-walls, and to form together a little community, serving God
    according to the primitive austere rule and spirit of the Order of
    St.&nbsp;Bennet. The abbess of St.&nbsp;Hilary gave them the
    ground on which they desired to build, and when the monastery was
    finished, the bishop of Paderborn, who attended the emperor
    Henry&nbsp;III. into Italy, consecrated the chapel. Pope
    Alexander&nbsp;II. in 1070 approved this new Order, together with
    the rule in which the saint added certain particular constitutions
    to the original rule of St.&nbsp;Bennet. From this confirmation is
    dated the foundation of the Order of Vallis-Umbrosa. St.&nbsp;John
    was chosen the first abbot, nor was he able to decline that
    dignity. He gave his monks a habit of an ash color; and settled
    among them retirement, silence, disengagement of their hearts from
    all earthly things, the most austere practice of penance, profound
    humility, and the most universal charity.</p>
  <p>
    Though most humble and mild, he severely reproved the least
    tepidity or sloth in others. For the virtue of meekness is not
    further removed from intemperate anger which clouds or dethrones
    reason, than from a vicious defect or tameness and stupidity which
    beholds vice with indifference. God has committed to every man a
    kind of trust and guardianship of virtue, whose rights we are
    obliged to maintain in proportion to our power not only by
    example, but also by advice, exhortation, and reproof, as often as
    it is reasonable. And he who regards the sins of others with a
    careless unconcernedness, makes himself accountable for them, when
    it is in his power to prevent them. Superiors especially lie under
    the most grievous obligations to check and chastise the
    irregularities and faults of those under their immediate care and
    inspection. Our saint feared no less the danger of too great
    lenity and forbearance than that of harshness; and was a true
    imitator both of the mildness and zeal of the Jewish legislator,
    whom the Holy Ghost calls “the meekest of all men upon the face of
    the earth.” St.&nbsp;John was himself a perfect model of all
    virtues, and tender and compassionate towards all, especially the
    sick. This compassion for them he learned by his own perpetual
    infirmities, and weakness of stomach. Such was his humility that
    he would never be promoted even to Minor Orders, never presumed to
    approach nearer the altar than was necessary to receive the holy
    communion, and never would open the church door, but always prayed
    one in Minor Orders to open it for him. He was very zealous for
    holy poverty, and would not allow any monasteries to be built in a
    costly or sumptuous manner, thinking such edifices not agreeable
    to a spirit of poverty. He founded the monastery of
    St.&nbsp;Salvi, that of Moscetta, that of Passignano, another at
    Rozzuolo, and another at Monte Salario. He reformed some other
    monasteries, and left about twelve houses of his Order at his
    death. Besides monks he received lay-brothers, who were exempt
    from choir and silence, and employed in external offices. This is
    said to be the first example of such a distinction; but it was
    soon imitated by other Orders. The saint’s charity to the poor was
    not less active than his love for holy poverty. He would have no
    poor person sent from his door without an alms, and often emptied
    all the granaries and stores of his monasteries in relieving them.
    In a great dearth he supplied, sometimes by miracle, the
    multitudes of poor people that flocked to his monastery of
    Rozzuolo. The saint was endowed with the spirit of prophecy, and
    by his prayers restored many sick persons to perfect health. The
    holy pope Leo&nbsp;IX. went to Passignano on purpose to see and
    converse with this holy man. Stephen&nbsp;IX. and
    Alexander&nbsp;II. had the greatest esteem for him. This latter
    testifies that the whole country where he lived owed to his zeal
    the entire extinction of simony. The holy man at length fell sick
    of a sharp fever at Passignano. He called for all the abbots and
    superiors of his Order, and telling them he was soon to leave
    them, strongly exhorted them to watch vigilantly over the most
    exact observance of their rule, and to maintain peace and
    fraternal charity. After this, having most devoutly received the
    last sacraments, he died happily on the 12th of July in 1073,
    being seventy-four years old. Pope Celestine&nbsp;III. having
    caused juridical informations to be taken concerning his virtues
    and miracles, solemnly enrolled him among the saints in the year
    1193.</p>
  <p>
    The eminent degree of penance and sanctity to which the divine
    grace raised this saint, was the fruit of his mildness in
    forgiving an injury. Christ not only commands us to pardon all
    offences, but has recommended this precept to us with his expiring
    breath, with his head crowned with thorns and his hands stretched
    out for us. We renounce the glorious title of being his disciples
    if, whilst we behold him hanging on the cross, and hear his last
    prayers, we trample on his sacred law, and harbor malice in our
    hearts against a brother whom our dying Redeemer commands us to
    forgive for his sake. Can we be angry with him who is by so many
    sacred ties our brother, the living son and member of our common
    Redeemer and Father, and whom we expect to be the associate of our
    happiness for all eternity? We owe infinitely more to Christ than
    any brother can owe to us: the least venial sin is an immense
    debt. Our Divine Master not only conjures us to forgive our
    brother for His sake, but also makes it our own infinite interest
    so to do, promising to pardon us our immense debts in the same
    manner as we pardon others. Shall we base worms who have nothing
    to boast of before men only our having concealed from them our
    baseness and ignominy; and to whom the most cruel outrages from
    creatures would be too mild a treatment, considering our sins;
    shall we, I&nbsp;say, complain of injuries which we ought to
    receive with patience and joy as the easy means of cancelling our
    own sins, and procuring for ourselves the greatest graces and
    mercy.</p>

  <p>
    The Roman provinces in Africa were for a long time one of the
    richest and most noble portions of the empire. The Carthaginian
    barbarism and perfidy had given place to the most flourishing
    reign of the sciences, arts, and religion. The nobles of this
    country were all princes, and for riches and state, seemed to vie
    with kings; its peace seemed on every side secure. But the
    strongest cities and empires are often nearest a fall; they are
    founded, to be again sooner or later torn to pieces. Every state
    has even within itself the seeds of its own destruction; these
    will occasion the dissolution of every body politic no less
    certainly than the internal weakness of the animal body must bring
    it to a fatal period. This was the condition of the Roman empire
    in its decline, when its rulers, to preserve Italy which they
    regarded as its heart or head, abandoned its extremities to the
    Goths and Vandals.<a id="c13_1a"> </a>At a time when Africa
    thought of no danger, in the reign of the emperor
    Valentinian&nbsp;III. in 428, Genseric, king of the Vandals and
    Alans, having lately made a settlement in part of Spain,<a
      href="#fn_118"
      class="anchor">118</a>
    passed into this country, and in a short time became master of
    those fertile provinces. This politic barbarian king kept great
    armies perpetually prepared for any expedition, by which he
    prevented the vigilance of his enemies, and astonished all the
    world with the rapidity of his enterprises. The Vandals, who were
    mostly Christians, but infected with the Arian heresy, laid the
    whole country waste by fire and sword, plundered all places, even
    churches and monasteries; burned alive two bishops, and tortured
    others to extort from them the treasures of their churches; razed
    the public buildings at Carthage, and banished Quodvultdeus,
    bishop of that city, with many others. But in 454, at the request
    of the emperor Valentinian, Genseric allowed the Catholics to
    choose a bishop of Carthage, and St.&nbsp;Deogratias was raised to
    that dignity, who died soon after Genseric was returned from the
    plunder of Rome. The persecution growing hotter, many suffered
    torments for the faith, and several received the crown of
    martyrdom.<a id="c13_1b"> </a>The Arians, by a sacrilege never
    before heard of, made themselves shirts and breeches of the
    altar-cloths, and at Tinuzuda spilt and scattered the body and
    blood of Christ on the pavement.<a
      href="#fn_119"
      class="anchor">119</a>
    Catholics being by an edict disqualified for bearing any office in
    the government, Armogastes, a nobleman who held an honorable post
    in the household of Theodoric the king’s son, was condemned by the
    tyrant to keep cattle. Genseric dying after a reign of
    thirty-seven years, was succeeded by his son Huneric, a more
    barbarous persecutor than his father had ever been.</p>
  <p>
    The episcopal see of Carthage had remained vacant twenty-four
    years, when in 481, Huneric permitted the Catholics on certain
    conditions to choose one who should fill it. The people, impatient
    to enjoy the comfort of a pastor, pitched upon Eugenius, a citizen
    of Carthage, eminent for his learning, zeal, piety, and prudence;
    and such was his deportment in this dignity, that he was venerable
    to the very heretics, and so dear to the Catholics that every one
    of them would have thought it a happiness to lay down his life for
    him. His charities to the distressed were excessive, especially
    considering his poverty. But he always found resources for their
    necessities in the hearts of his people; and he refused himself
    everything that he might give all to the poor. When others put him
    in mind that he ought to reserve something for his own
    necessaries, his answer was: “If the good pastor must lay down his
    life for his flock, can it be excusable for me to be solicitous
    for the necessities of my body?” He fasted every day, and often
    allowed himself only a most slender evening refection of bread and
    water. His virtue gained him the respect and esteem even of the
    Arians; but at length envy and blind zeal got the ascendant in
    their breasts, and the king sent him an order never to sit in the
    episcopal throne, preach to the people, or admit into his chapel
    any Vandals among whom several were Catholics. The saint boldly
    answered the messenger, that the laws of God commanded him not to
    shut the door of his church to any that desired to serve him in
    it. Huneric, enraged at this answer, persecuted the Catholics many
    ways, especially the Vandals who had embraced the faith. He
    commanded guards to be placed at the doors of the Catholic
    churches, who when they saw any man or woman going in clothed in
    the habit of the Vandals, struck them on the head with short
    staffs jagged and indented, which being twisted into their hair,
    and drawn back with great violence, tore off the hair and skin
    together. Some lost their eyes by this means, and others died with
    the extreme pain; but many lived a long time after. Women with
    their heads flayed in this manner, were publicly led through the
    streets, with a crier going before them to show them to the
    people. But this barbarous usage did not cause any one to forsake
    the true religion. Next, the tyrant deprived the Catholics who
    were at court of their pensions, and sent them to work in the
    country. He also ordered that none should be admitted to bear any
    office in his palace, or any public charge, who was not an Arian.
    He afterward turned them out of their houses, stripped them of
    all their wealth, and sent them to Sicily, or Sardinia. After
    this, his persecution fell on all Catholics. One edict followed
    another against them, and the cloud thickened every day over their
    heads. Many nuns were so cruelly tortured that several died on the
    rack. Great numbers of bishops, priests, deacons, and eminent
    Catholic laymen were banished to the number of four thousand nine
    hundred and seventy-six, all of whom the tyrant sent into a
    desert, where they were fed with barley like horses. This desert
    was filled with scorpions and venomous serpents; but they did not
    destroy any of the servants of God. The people followed their
    bishops and priests with lighted tapers in their hands, and
    mothers carried their little babes in their arms, and laid them
    at the feet of the confessors, all crying out with tears,—“Going
    yourselves to your crowns, to whom do you leave us? Who will
    baptize our children? Who will impart to us the benefit of
    penance, and discharge us from the bonds of sins by the favor of
    reconciliation and pardon?<a id="c13_1c"> </a>Who will bury us
    with solemn supplications at our death? By whom will divine
    sacrifices be made?”<a
      href="#fn_120"
      class="anchor">120</a></p>
  <p>
    The bishop Eugenius was spared in the first storm, probably that
    the inhabitants of the capital might seem to be somewhat
    considered. But in May, 483, the king sent him a summons requiring
    the Catholics, whom he called Homoousians, to hold a conference or
    disputation with his Arian bishops at Carthage on the 1st day of
    February ensuing.<a id="c13_1d"> </a>Eugenius answered the terms
    were not equal, seeing their enemies were to be judges; and that
    as it was the common cause of all churches, other foreign churches
    ought to be invited and consulted, “especially the church of Rome,
    which is the head of all churches.”<a
      href="#fn_121"
      class="anchor">121</a>
    About that time one Felix, who had been long blind, addressed
    himself to St.&nbsp;Eugenius desiring him to pray that he might
    recover his sight, saying he had been admonished by a vision so to
    do. The bishop showed great reluctance and confusion, alleging
    that he was a base sinner; but at length, after blessing the font
    for the solemn administration of baptism on the Epiphany, he said
    to the blind man,—“I&nbsp;have told you that I&nbsp;am a sinner,
    and the last of all men; but I&nbsp;pray God that he show you
    mercy according to your faith, and restore to you your sight.”
    Then he made the sign of the cross on his eyes, and the blind man
    saw; the whole city was witness to the triumph of the faith. The
    king sent for Felix, and examined himself all the circumstances of
    the miracle, which he found too evident to be called in question.
    However, the Arian bishops told him that Eugenius had performed it
    by recourse to art magic. The Catholics made choice of ten
    disputants for the conference, which was opened on the 5th of
    February. Cyrila, patriarch of the Arians, was seated on a throne;
    the Catholics who were standing, asked who were the commissaries
    to take down in writing what should pass in the disputation; and
    were answered that Cyrila would perform that office. The Catholics
    asked by what authority he claimed the jurisdiction and rank of
    patriarch. The Arians not being able to produce any sufficient
    warrant for his usurpation, filled the hall with noise and tumult
    and obtained an order that every lay Catholic there present should
    receive a hundred bastinadoes. Cyrila sought various pretences to
    defer the conference. The Catholics, however, presented a written
    confession of their faith. This takes up the whole third book of
    Victor’s history, though he has only inserted the first part, in
    which the consubstantiality of God the Son is proved from the
    scriptures. The second part, which confirmed the same from the
    writings of the fathers, is lost.<a id="c13_1e"> </a>This
    confession seems to have been drawn up by St.&nbsp;Eugenius, to
    whom Gennadius ascribes a confession of faith against the
    Arians.<a
      href="#fn_122"
      class="anchor">122</a>
    When this was read the Arians quarrelled that the orthodox took
    the name of Catholics, though this was given them by the whole
    world, even by the heretics themselves, as St.&nbsp;Austin
    observed a little before this time in that very country. Upon
    this, however, the Arians abruptly broke up the conference, and
    the king, on the 25th of February in 484, published a severe edict
    for a general persecution, which he had already prepared for that
    purpose. By this all the Catholic clergy were banished out of
    towns, and forbidden to perform any functions even in the country;
    all Catholics were declared incapable of inheriting, or disposing
    of any estates real or personal, with other such articles.
    Executioners were despatched to all parts of the kingdom, and many
    Catholics were put to barbarous deaths, and many more inhumanly
    tormented. One Dionysia, after having been herself cruelly
    scourged, seeing her son Majoricus, a tender youth, tremble at the
    sign of the torments prepared for him, she looked on him with a
    stern countenance, and said,—“Remember, son, we were baptized in
    the name of the Trinity, and in the bosom of our mother the
    Church.” The young man, encouraged by these words, suffered
    martyrdom with undaunted resolution, and his mother buried him
    within her own house, that she might every day offer to the holy
    Trinity her prayers over his grave, in the lively hope of a
    glorious resurrection with him at the last day. Her cousin
    Emilius, her sister Dativa, and innumerable others in different
    parts of Africa, received the like crowns.<a id="c13_1f"> </a>At
    Typasus, in Mauritania Cæsariensis, certain Catholics who had
    assisted at the celebration of the divine mysteries in a private
    house, were informed against; and by the king’s order had their
    tongues plucked out, and their right hands cut off; yet they spoke
    as well as ever, as St.&nbsp;Victor Vitensis, an eye-witness,
    assures us.<a
      href="#fn_123"
      class="anchor">123</a>
    He says, Reparatus, a subdeacon, one of this number, was
    entertained when he wrote, in the court of the emperor Zena at
    Constantinople, and was there highly honored, especially by the
    empress; and that though entirely deprived of his tongue, he spoke
    gracefully, and without the least defect or imperfection.<a
    id="c13_1g"> </a>Æneas of Gaza, a Platonic philosopher, who was
    then at Constantinople, and wrote in 533,<a
      href="#fn_124"

    says, he himself had seen them in that city, and had heard them
    speak distinctly; and not being able to believe his own ears, he
    had examined their mouths, and seen that their tongues were
    plucked out to the very roots, so that he wondered they could have
    survived so cruel a torment.<a id="c13_1h"> </a>Procopius, who
    wrote soon after, says also<a
      href="#fn_125"
      class="anchor">125</a>
    that he had seen these persons at Constantinople, and had heard
    them speak freely, without feeling anything of their punishment;
    but that two of them, by falling into a grievous sin of the flesh,
    lost the use of their speech, which they had till then
    enjoyed.</p>
  <p>
    The tyrant wreaked his impotent vengeance on many others,
    especially on Vandals who had been converted to the Catholic
    faith; but was not able to overcome their heroic constancy. The
    streets of Carthage were filled with spectacles of his cruelty;
    and one was there meeting continually some without hands, others
    without eyes, nose, or ears, others whose heads appeared sunk in
    between their shoulders by having been hung up by the hands on the
    tops of houses for sights to the people. Above four hundred and
    sixty bishops were brought to Carthage in order to be sent into
    banishment: of this number eighty-eight died under great hardships
    at Carthage, some few made their escape, and the rest were
    banished. St.&nbsp;Eugenius after having long encouraged others to
    the conflict was himself at length on a sudden carried into exile,
    without being allowed to take leave of his friends.<a id="c13_1i">
    </a>He found means, however, to write a letter to his flock, which
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours has preserved.<a
      href="#fn_126"
      class="anchor">126</a>
    In it he says,—“I&nbsp;with tears beg, exhort, and conjure you by
    the dreadful day of judgment, and the awful light of the coming of
    Christ, that you hold fast the Catholic faith. Preserve the grace
    of the holy baptism, and the unction of the chrism. Let no man
    born again of water return to the water.” This he mentions,
    because the Arians in Africa, like the Donatists, rebaptized those
    that came over to their sect. St.&nbsp;Eugenius protests to his
    flock that if they remain constant, no distance nor death could
    separate him from them in spirit; but that he was innocent of the
    blood of those that should perish, and that this his letter would
    be read before the tribunal of Christ at the last day for severer
    condemnation of such base apostates. “If I&nbsp;return to
    Carthage,” says he, “I&nbsp;shall see you in this life; if not,
    I&nbsp;shall meet you in the other. Pray for us, and fast; fasting
    and alms have never failed to move God to mercy. Above all things
    remember that we are not to fear those who can only kill the
    body.”</p>
  <p id="c13_1j">
    We have a catalogue of all the bishops of the provinces of Africa
    who came to the conference, and were sent into banishment;<a
      href="#fn_127"
      class="anchor">127</a>
    namely, fifty-four of the proconsular province, one hundred and
    twenty-five of Numidia, one hundred and seven of the province of
    Byzacena, one hundred and twenty of the province of Mauritania
    Cæsariensis, forty-four from the province of Sitifi, five from
    that of Tripolis, besides ten from Sardinia and other places; in
    all four hundred and sixty-four bishops, of which number
    eighty-eight died at Carthage before their departure into exile,
    forty-six were banished to Corsica, three hundred and three to
    other places, and twenty-eight made their escape.
    St.&nbsp;Eugenius was carried into the uninhabited desert country
    in the province of Tripolis, and committed to the guard of Antony,
    an inhuman Arian bishop, who treated him with the utmost
    barbarity. The saint added to his sufferings voluntary
    austerities, wore a rough hair-shirt, lay on the ground, and
    passed great part of the night in prayer and tears. When he was
    afflicted with a palsy, Antony, because vinegar was contrary to
    his distemper, obliged him to drink it in large quantities. Yet
    God was pleased to restore his servant to his health. It is
    observed by our historian, that the Arian bishops were all cruel
    persecutors, and went through the cities and provinces, filling
    all places with scenes of horror, rebaptizing persons by force and
    violence, scourging, mangling, torturing, and banishing even women
    and children. The fifth book of the history of this persecution is
    filled with examples. The apostates signalized themselves above
    others by the cruelties which they exercised upon the orthodox.
    Elpidophorus, one of this number, was appointed judge at Carthage
    to condemn the more zealous to be tortured. Muritta, the deacon
    who had assisted when he was baptized in the bosom of the Catholic
    Church, being brought before him, took with him the chrismale or
    white garment, with which at the time he received the apostate
    coming out of the font he had clothed him, as an emblem of that
    innocence which he engaged himself to preserve always unspotted;
    and producing it before the whole assembly, he says,—“This robe
    will accuse you when the judge shall appear in majesty at the last
    day.<a id="c13_1k"> </a>It will bear testimony against you to your
    condemnation.”<a
      href="#fn_128"
      class="anchor">128</a>
    <a id="c13_1l"> </a>This relation is gathered from Saint Victor,
    bishop of Vita, in the province of Byzacena; who being banished by
    king Huneric for the faith in 487, retired to Constantinople, and
    wrote (probably in that city) in five books, the history of the
    Vandalic persecution.<a
      href="#fn_129"
      class="anchor">129</a></p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Victor relates that Huneric, the great persecutor of the
    Church, died miserably, being devoured by worms, in December, 484,
    having reigned almost eight years. Nor was he succeeded, as he had
    earnestly desired, by his son Hilderic, but by Gontamund, a
    nephew, whom the maturity of his age rendered better able to bear
    the burden of the state. This prince, in the year 488, which was
    the fourth of his reign, recalled St.&nbsp;Eugenius to Carthage,
    and at his request opened the churches of the Catholics, and
    permitted the exiled priests also to return. Gontamund died in
    496, and his brother Thrasimund was called to the crown, of whom
    mention hath been made in the life of St.&nbsp;Fulgentius. Though
    this king often affected a show of moderation, he sometimes used
    the sword and every other violent measure to depress the cause of
    truth, which at other times he pretended to seek after. But his
    inconstancy betrayed his want of sincerity. True virtue is steady,
    but the fool changeth like the moon; he who is governed by his
    passions, is everything by fits, and if he one day pretends to
    condemn his vices, he by relapses soon repents again of this very
    repentance, which frequently springs rather from a disgust of sin,
    than from any principle of true virtue. Thrasimund by this levity
    or hypocrisy never deserved to arrive at the light of the true
    faith, and often persecuted its most holy champions, of which
    among many others the sufferings of St.&nbsp;Eugenius are an
    instance.<a id="c13_1m"> </a>St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours relates<a
      href="#fn_130"
      class="anchor">130</a>
    that by his authority the judges condemned our saint, one
    Longinus, and St.&nbsp;Vindemial, bishop of Capsa, in Africa, to
    be beheaded. St. Vindemial died by the sword; but the tyrant
    commanded St.&nbsp;Eugenius to be led to the place of execution,
    and though he protested under the axe that he would rather lose
    his life than depart from the Catholic faith, he was again brought
    back to Carthage, and banished into Languedoc, which country was
    then subject to Alaric, king of the Visigoths, who was also an
    Arian. He died in his exile in a monastery which he built and
    governed at Viance (since called St.&nbsp;Amaranth’s from the tomb
    of that martyr), about a mile from Albi. He passed to a better
    life in 505, on the 13th of July.<a id="c13_1n"> </a>King Hilderic
    afterward recalled the surviving exiled prelates; but peace was
    not perfectly restored to that church before the year 534, when
    Belisarius, a general who was master of all the maxims of the
    first Romans with regard to the art of war, vanquished Gelimer,
    the last Vandal king in Africa, and sent him prisoner to
    Constantinople.<a

    from God, to direct us amidst our darkness in the path to eternal
    life, as the pillar of fire conducted the Israelites through the
    wilderness. It is the seed, or rather the root of a spiritual
    life, and of every virtue that is meritorious of everlasting
    glory.<a id="c13_1p"> </a>“Faith is the solid foundation of all

      class="anchor">134</a>
    “O&nbsp;faith, richer than all treasures! more healing and
    sovereign than all medicines!” Our faith if true must have three
    conditions or qualities.<a id="c13_1r"> </a>1.&nbsp;It must be
    firm, admitting no doubt or wavering; ready to brave all dangers,
    torments, and death; thus it filled the martyrs with joy under the
    most affrighting trials, and made them triumph over fires and the
    sword.<a
      href="#fn_135"
      class="anchor">135</a>
    2.&nbsp;It must be entire; for the least wilful obstinate error
    concerning one article destroys the whole fabric of faith, by
    rejecting its motive which is everywhere the same testimony of
    divine revelation. “You who believe what you please, and reject
    what you please, believe yourselves or your own fancy, rather than
    the gospel,” as St.&nbsp;Austin says. 3.&nbsp;Faith must be
    active, animated by charity, fruitful in good works. A&nbsp;dead
    or a barren faith is compared by St.&nbsp;James to a carcass
    without a soul, and to the faith of the devils who believe and
    tremble. How active and animated was faith in the souls of all the
    saints! the eminent virtues which we admire in them were all the
    fruit of their faith, and sprang from this root. With what care
    ought we to nourish and improve this holy seed in our breasts?
    Gardeners cultivate most diligently those seeds which are most
    precious.</p>

    SAINT TURIAF, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;DOL, IN&nbsp;BRITTANY.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    CALLED OFTEN TURIAVE, SOMETIMES&nbsp;THIVISIAU.</p>
  <p>
    Was born in the diocess of Vannes, in the neighborhood of the
    abbey of Ballon, near which Charles the Bald was defeated by the
    Britons in 845; in which war this monastery seems to have been
    destroyed. Turiaf went young to Dol, was instructed in piety and
    learning, and promoted to holy orders by St.&nbsp;Thiarmail, abbot
    of St.&nbsp;Samson’s and bishop of Dol. This prelate afterward
    appointed him his vicar and chorepiscopus, and at his death,
    probably in 733, our saint was placed in that episcopal chair.
    Admirable was the austerity of his life, his zeal, his charity,
    his watchfulness, his fervor in prayer, and his firmness in
    maintaining discipline. A&nbsp;powerful lord named Rivallon having
    committed many acts of violence, the bishop went to his castle at
    Lanncafrut, and by his strong remonstrances made him sensible of
    the enormity of his crimes. By the bishop’s injunction he
    underwent a canonical penance during seven years, and repaired all
    injustices and oppressions by a sevenfold satisfaction.
    St.&nbsp;Turiaf died on the 13th of July, probably about the year
    749, though even the age is not certain. In the wars of the
    Normans his relics were brought to Paris, and are still kept in
    the abbey of St. Germain-des-Prez. The new Paris breviary mentions
    that dreadful fires have been sometimes miraculously extinguished
    by them. The life of St.&nbsp;Turiaf, written in the tenth
    century, is a confused eulogium, in which prodigies take place of
    facts. The notes of the Bollandists are incomparably more valuable

    ST.&nbsp;BONAVENTURE, CARDINAL.</h3>

    BISHOP AND DOCTOR OF THE CHURCH.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    From his works, Wadding’s Annals of the Friar Minors, the
    discourse of Octavian de Marinis for his canonization, and from
    his Life, written by Peter Galesini, by order of Sixtus&nbsp;V.

  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1274.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure, the great light and ornament of the holy
    Order of St.&nbsp;Francis, for his extraordinary devotion, ardent
    charity, and eminent skill in sacred learning, is surnamed the
    Seraphic Doctor. He was born at Bagnarea in Tuscany, in the year
    1221, of pious parents, named John of Fidenza and Mary Ritelli. He
    was christened by the name of John; but afterward received that of
    Bonaventure on the following occasion. In the fourth year of his
    age he fell so dangerously sick that his life was despaired of by
    the physicians. The mother in excessive grief had recourse to the
    Almighty physician by earnest prayer, and going into Umbria cast
    herself at the feet of St.&nbsp;Francis of Assisium, with many
    tears begging his intercession with God for the life of her son.
    Would Christians address themselves to God with an humble
    confidence in all their corporal necessities, their afflictions
    would never fail to be turned into divine blessings. But their
    neglect of this duty deserves to be chastised by spiritual
    misfortunes, and often also by temporal disappointments without
    comfort or remedy.<a id="c14_1a"> </a>St.&nbsp;Francis was moved
    to compassion by the tears of the mother, and at his prayer the
    child recovered so perfect a state of health that he was never
    known to be sick from that time till the illness of which he
    died.<a
      href="#fn_137"
      class="anchor">137</a>
    The glorious saint, at whose petition God granted this favor, saw
    himself near the end of his mortal course, and foretelling the
    graces which the divine goodness prepared for this child, cried
    out in prophetic rapture; <i>O&nbsp;buona ventura</i>, that is, in
    Italian, <i>Good luck</i>. Whence the name of Bonaventura was
    given our saint. The devout mother in gratitude consecrated her
    son to God by a vow, and was careful to inspire into him from the
    cradle the most ardent sentiments of piety, and to inure him
    betimes to assiduous practices of self-denial, humility,
    obedience, and devotion. Bonaventure from his infancy entered upon
    a religious course, and appeared inflamed with the love of God as
    soon as he was capable of knowing him. His progress in his studies
    surprised his masters, but that which he made in the science of
    the saints, and in the practice of every virtue was far more
    extraordinary. It was his highest pleasure and joy to hear by how
    many titles he belonged to God, and he made it his most earnest
    study and endeavor to devote his heart with his whole strength to
    the divine service.</p>
  <p id="c14_1b">
    In 1243, being twenty-two years of age, he entered into the Order
    of St.&nbsp;Francis, and received the habit in the province of
    Rome from the hands of Haymo, an Englishman, at that time general
    of the Order.<a
      href="#fn_138"
      class="anchor">138</a>
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure mentions in his prologue to the life of Saint
    Francis, that he entered this state, and made his vows with
    extraordinary sentiments of gratitude for the preservation of his
    life through the intercession of St.&nbsp;Francis, resolving with
    the greatest ardor to serve God with his whole heart.<a
    id="c14_1c"> </a>Shortly after, he was sent to Paris to complete
    his studies under the celebrated Alexander of Hales, surnamed the
    Irrefragable Doctor.<a
      href="#fn_139"
      class="anchor">139</a>
    After his death in 1245, St.&nbsp;Bonaventure continued his course
    under his successor, John of Rochelle. His penetrating genius was
    poised by the most exquisite judgment, by which, while he easily
    dived to the bottom of every subtle inquiry, he cut off whatever
    was superfluous, dwelling only on that knowledge which is useful
    and solid, or at least was then necessary to unravel the false
    principles and artful sophistry of the adversaries of truth. Thus
    he became a masterly proficient in the scholastic philosophy, and
    in the most sublime parts of theology. Whilst he referred all his
    studies to the divine honor and his own sanctification he was most
    careful not to lose the end in the means, and suffer his
    application to degenerate into a dissipation of mind and a vicious
    idle curiosity. This opens an avenue into the heart for
    self-conceit, jealousy, envy, and a total extinction of the spirit
    of prayer, with a numberless train of other spiritual evils, which
    lay waste the affections of the soul, and banish thence the
    precious fruits of the Holy Ghost. To shun those rocks often fatal
    to piety, he seemed never to turn his attention from God, and by
    the earnest invocation of the divine light in the beginning of
    every action, and holy aspirations with which he accompanied all
    his studies, he may be said to have made them a continued prayer.
    When he turned his eyes to his book, they were swimming with tears
    of love and devotion excited by his assiduous meditation on the
    wounds of Christ, and his heart still continued to inflame its
    affections from that its beloved object, which he seemed to read
    in every line. St.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas coming one day to pay a
    visit to our saint, asked him in what books he had learned his
    sacred science. St.&nbsp;Bonaventure, pointing to his crucifix
    before him, said, “This is the source of all my knowledge.
    I&nbsp;study only Jesus Christ, and him crucified.”</p>
  <p>
    Not content to make his studies in some sort a continuation of
    prayer, he devoted entirely to that heavenly exercise the greater
    part of his time, knowing this to be the key of divine graces and
    of a spiritual life. For only the Spirit of God, as St.&nbsp;Paul
    teaches, can lead us into the secrets and designs of God, and
    engrave his holy maxims on our hearts. He alone can make himself
    known, as no other light can discover the sun to us but its own;
    and it is in prayer that God communicates himself to us. He here
    enlightens the souls of his servants, and is their interior
    instructor. But as St.&nbsp;Austin says, honey cannot be poured
    into a vessel that is full of wormwood: neither can this excellent
    grace or gift of prayer find place in a soul which is not first
    prepared to receive the sensible presence of the Holy Ghost by
    holy compunction, and by the practice of penance, humility, and
    self-denial. These virtues fitted the soul of our saint to be
    admitted to the chaste embraces of the heavenly bridegroom. Such
    was the innocence and purity in which he lived, and so perfect a
    mastery he had obtained over his passions, that Alexander of Hales
    used to say to him, that he seemed not to have sinned in Adam. An
    eminent spirit of penance was the principal guardian of this grace
    of innocence.<a id="c14_1d"> </a>The austerities of Saint
    Bonaventure were excessive, yet amidst his penitential tears a
    remarkable cheerfulness appeared always in his countenance, which
    resulted from the inward peace of his soul. Himself lays down this
    maxim:<a
      href="#fn_140"
      class="anchor">140</a>
    “A spiritual joy is the greatest sign of the divine grace dwelling
    in a soul.”</p>
  <p>
    To his mortifications he added the practice of the greatest
    humiliations. In attending the sick he was particularly ambitious
    to serve them in the lowest and most humbling offices. In this
    charitable duty he seemed prodigal of his own life and health, and
    chose always to be about those whose distempers were most
    loathsome or contagious and dangerous. He had no eyes to see
    anything in himself but faults and imperfections, and wonderful
    was the care with which he endeavored to conceal from others his
    extraordinary practices of virtue. When their rays broke through
    the veil of his humility, and shone forth to others, the saint in
    order to cast a shade over them before men, or at least to
    strengthen his own heart against the danger, and to indulge his
    love of abjection, embraced the greatest humiliations. He always
    regarded himself as the most ungrateful and the basest of sinners,
    unworthy to walk upon the earth, or to breathe the air; and these
    humble sentiments were accompanied with the deepest compunction,
    and abundant tears. This humility sometimes withheld him from the
    holy table notwithstanding the burning desires of his soul to be
    united daily afresh to the object of his love, and to approach the
    fountain of grace. But God was pleased by a miracle to overcome
    his fears, and to recompense his humility. “Several days had
    passed,” say the acts of his canonization, “nor durst he yet
    presume to present himself at the heavenly banquet. But whilst he
    was hearing mass, and meditating on the passion of Jesus Christ,
    our Saviour, to crown his humility and love, put into his mouth,
    by the ministry of an angel, part of the consecrated host, taken
    from the hand of the priest.” By this precious favor his soul was
    drowned in a torrent of pure delights; and from that time he was
    encouraged to approach with an humble confidence to the bread of
    angels which gives life and strength.</p>
  <p>
    From this time his communions were accompanied with overflowing
    sweetness and consolations, and with raptures of divine joy and
    love. If in our communions we seem to receive, instead of
    torrents, scarce a small portion of heavenly grace, the reason is,
    because our hearts are too narrow. The vessel which we bring is
    too small. If we dilated our souls by humility, burning desires,
    and love, we should receive, like the saints, an abundant supply
    of these living waters. St.&nbsp;Bonaventure prepared himself to
    receive the holy order of priesthood by long fasts, humiliations,
    and fervent prayer, that he might obtain in it an abundant measure
    of graces proportioned to so high a function. He considered that
    sacred dignity with fear and trembling, and the higher and more
    incomprehensible it appeared to him, so much the more did he
    humble himself when he saw himself invested with it. As often as
    he approached the altar, the profound annihilation of himself, and
    the tender love with which he offered, beheld in his hands, and
    received into his breast, the Lamb without spot, appeared by his
    tears, and his whole exterior. A&nbsp;devout prayer which he
    composed for his own use after Mass, beginning with these words,
    <i>Transfige dulcissime domine</i>, is recommended by the Church
    to all priests on that most solemn occasion.</p>
  <p>
    Bonaventure looked upon himself as called by the obligations of
    his priestly character to labor for the salvation of his neighbor,
    and to this he devoted himself with extraordinary zeal. He
    announced the word of God to the people with an energy and unction
    which kindled a flame in the hearts of those that heard him;
    everything was inflamed that came from his mouth. For an
    assistance to himself in this function he compiled his treatise
    called Pharetra, consisting of animated sentiments gathered from
    the writings of the fathers. In the meantime, he was employed in
    teaching privately in his own convent, till he succeeded his late
    master, John of Rochelle, in a public chair of the university. The
    age required by the statutes for this professorship was
    thirty-five, whereas the saint was only thirty-three years old;
    but his abilities amply supplied that defect, and on this literary
    theatre he soon displayed them to the admiration of the whole
    Church. He continued always to study at the foot of the crucifix.
    The disagreement between the university and the regulars being
    terminated by pope Alexander&nbsp;IV. in 1256, Saint Thomas and
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure were invited to take the doctor’s cap
    together. As others contend for precedence, the two saints had a
    vehement contest of humility, each endeavoring to yield the first
    place to the other. They knew no pretexts of the interest of their
    Orders, nor were they sensible of any prerogatives but those of
    humility. St.&nbsp;Bonaventure prayed and entreated him with so
    much earnestness, that at length St.&nbsp;Thomas acquiesced to
    receive the degree first, and our saint triumphed over both his
    friend and himself.</p>
  <p>
    The holy king of St.&nbsp;Lewis honored St.&nbsp;Bonaventure with
    his particular esteem, invited him often to his own table, and
    consulted him in his most intricate concerns, placing an entire
    confidence in his advice. He engaged him to compile an office of
    the passion of Christ for his use. St.&nbsp;Bonaventure drew up a
    rule for St.&nbsp;Isabella, the king’s sister, and for her nunnery
    of mitigated Clares at Long-Champs. His book On the Government of
    the Soul, his Meditations for every day in the week, and most of
    his other lesser tracts were written to satisfy the requests of
    several devout persons of the court. The unction which every word
    breathes in the writings of this holy doctor pierces the heart,
    and his concise expression is an abyss, or rather a treasure of
    most profound sentiments of humility, compunction, love, and
    devotion, the riches of which a pious heart finds everywhere
    boundless. Especially his tender sentiments of the love of God,
    and on the sacred passion of Christ, exceedingly recommend to all
    devout persons his meditations on this latter subject, and express
    the burning affections with which his pure soul glowed towards
    that stupendous mystery of infinite love, goodness, and mercy,
    that perfect model of all virtue and sanctity, and source of all
    our good.</p>
  <p id="c14_1e">
    The celebrated Gerson, the most learned and devout chancellor of
    Paris, writes of the works of St.&nbsp;Bonaventure.<a
      href="#fn_141"
      class="anchor">141</a>
    “Among all the Catholic doctors, Eustachius (for so we may
    translate his name of Bonaventure) seems to me the most proper for
    conveying light to the understanding, and at the same time warming
    the heart.<a id="c14_1f"> </a>In particular his Brevioloquium and
    Itinerarium are written with so much force, art, and conciseness,
    that nothing can be beyond them.” In another book he says:<a
      href="#fn_142"
      class="anchor">142</a>
    “St.&nbsp;Bonaventure’s works seem to me the most proper for the
    instruction of the faithful. They are solid, safe, pious, and
    devout; and he keeps as far as he can from niceties; not meddling
    with logical or physical questions which are foreign to the matter
    in hand. Nor is there any doctrine more sublime, more divine, or
    more conducive to piety.” Trithemius recommends this doctor’s
    writings in the following words: “His expressions are full of
    fire, they no less warm with divine love the hearts of those who
    read them, than they fill their understanding with the most holy
    light. His works surpass those of all the doctors of his time, if
    we consider the spirit of divine love and of Christian devotion
    that speaks in him. He is profound in few words, penetrating
    without curiosity, eloquent without vanity; his discourse is
    inflamed without being bloated.<a id="c14_1g"> </a>Whoever would
    be both learned and devout, let him read the works of
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure.”<a
      href="#fn_143"
      class="anchor">143</a></p>
  <p>
    This is chiefly to be understood of his spiritual tracts. In these
    the author discovers everywhere a most profound spirit of humility
    and holy poverty, with a heart perfectly disengaged from all
    earthly things, and full of the most ardent love of God, and the
    most tender devotion to the sacred passion of our Divine Redeemer.
    The eternal joys of heaven were the frequent entertainment of his
    pious soul, and he seems never to have interrupted his ardent
    sighs after them. He endeavored by his writings to excite in all
    others the same fervent desires of our heavenly country.<a
    id="c14_1h"> </a>He writes<a
      href="#fn_144"
      class="anchor">144</a>
    that “God himself, all the glorious spirits, and the whole family
    of the eternal King wait for us, and desire that we should be
    associated to them; and shall not we pant above all things to be
    admitted into their happy company? He would appear amongst them
    with great confusion, who had not in this valley of tears
    continually raised his soul above all things visible to become
    already, in ardent desire, an inhabitant of those blessed
    regions.” He clearly shows that he was not able to express the
    transports of holy joy that overflowed his soul, as often as he
    contemplated its future union with God in immortal bliss and
    uninterrupted love and praise. He revolved in mind the raptures of
    gratitude and joy in which the blessed spirits behold themselves
    in the state of security for ever, whilst they see so many souls
    on earth every day overthrown by their spiritual enemies, and so
    many others lost in hell. He was strongly affected with the
    thought of the glorious company of millions of angels and saints,
    all most holy, loving, and glorious, adorned each with their
    distinguishing trophies and graces; in which every one will
    possess in others every gift which he hath not, and all those
    gifts which himself hath, doubled so many times as he hath
    partners in bliss. For loving every companion as himself he will
    rejoice for the felicity of each no less than for his own.
    Whereupon, with St.&nbsp;Anselm, he often asked his own heart,
    here so poor, so weak, and overwhelmed with miseries, if then it
    would be able, without being strengthened and raised above itself
    by an extraordinary grace, to contain its joy for its own
    felicity; how it could be able to contain so many and such excess
    of joys. But this saint’s sublime sentiments of piety and devotion
    are best learned from his own works. His love of an interior life
    did not hinder his application to promote the divine honor in
    others by various exterior employments; but these he animated and
    sanctified by a constant spirit of recollection and prayer.</p>
  <p>
    Whilst he continued to teach at Paris he was chosen general of his
    Order in a chapter held in the convent called Ara-Cœli, at Rome,
    in 1256. The saint was only thirty-five years old. Nevertheless
    pope Alexander&nbsp;IV. confirmed the election.
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure was thunderstruck at this news, and
    prostrating himself on the ground, he with many tears implored the
    divine light and direction. After which he set out immediately for
    Rome. The Franciscan Order was at that time divided by intestine
    dissensions, some of the friars being for an inflexible severity,
    others demanding certain mitigations of the letter of the rule.
    The young general no sooner appeared among them, but by the force
    of his exhortations which he tempered with mildness and charity,
    he restored a perfect calm; and all the brethren marched under
    this new Josue with one heart, in the same spirit, and in the same
    path. William of Saint-Amour, a member of the university of Paris,
    having published a bitter invective against the Mendicant Orders,
    entitled, “On the Dangers of the Latter Times,” St.&nbsp;Thomas
    answered it. St.&nbsp;Bonaventure also confuted it by a book,
    which he called, “On the Poverty of the Lord Jesus,” in which his
    mildness in handling the controversy against a most virulent
    adversary reflected a double advantage on his victory.</p>
  <p>
    Our saint, in his return to the schools at Paris, visited several
    of his convents in the way, in which he showed everywhere that he
    was only become superior to be the most humble, the most
    charitable, and the most compassionate of all his brethren, and
    the servant of his whole Order. Notwithstanding his great
    employments, he never omitted his usual exercises of devotion, but
    laid out his time and regulated his functions with such wonderful
    prudence as to find leisure for everything. He composed several
    works at Paris, but often retired to Mante for greater solitude.
    A&nbsp;stone, which he used for his pillow, is shown to this day
    in that convent. In 1260 the saint held a general chapter at
    Narbonne, and in concert with the definitors, gave a new form to
    the old Constitutions, added certain new rules, and reduced them
    all into twelve chapters. At the request of the friars assembled
    in this chapter, he undertook to write the life of St.&nbsp;
    Francis; but went first from Narbonne to Mount Alverno, and there
    assisted at the dedication of a great church. In a little oratory,
    built upon the very place where Saint Francis had received the
    miraculous marks of the wounds of our Saviour,
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure continued a long while abstracted, and in an
    ecstasy, in holy meditation. He there wrote his incomparable
    treatise, called Itinerarium Mentis in Deum, or the Way of the
    Soul to God, showing that all her comfort and riches are to be
    found in God alone, and tracing out the sure way that leads to
    him. Whilst he was in Italy he gathered the most authentic memoirs
    for the life of St.&nbsp;Francis, which he compiled with the
    spirit which shows him to have been filled with all the heroic
    virtues of his founder, whose life he wrote. St.&nbsp;Thomas
    Aquinas coming one day to pay him a visit whilst he was employed
    in this work, saw him through the door of his cell, raised in
    contemplation above the ground, and going away, said: “Let us
    leave a saint to write for a saint.” In 1230 St.&nbsp;Bonaventure
    assisted at the translation of the relics of St.&nbsp;Antony,
    which was performed at Padua. From that city he went to hold a
    general chapter at Pisa, in which, by words and example, he
    exhorted his brethren to a great love of holy solitude. He gave on
    that and every other occasion proofs of his tender devotion to the
    Blessed Virgin. When he was first made general he put his Order
    under her special patronage. He regulated many pious exercises of
    devotion to her, composed his Mirror of the Virgin, setting forth
    her graces, virtues, and prerogatives, with many prayers, which
    are tender and respectful effusions of the heart, to implore her
    intercession.<a id="c14_1i"> </a>He wrote a pathetic paraphrase in
    verse of the anthem Salve Regina.<a
      href="#fn_145"
      class="anchor">145</a>
    He published the praises of the Mother out of devotion to the Son,
    and to extend His glory. To propagate his honor and saving faith
    he sent, by the pope’s authority, preachers into many barbarous
    nations, and lamented his situation that he could not go himself,
    and expose his life among the infidels.</p>
  <p id="c14_1j">
    The venerable brother Giles, the third companion of
    St.&nbsp;Francis at Assisio,<a
      href="#fn_146"
      class="anchor">146</a>
    said one day to St.&nbsp;Bonaventure: “Father, God has shown us
    great mercy and bestowed on us many graces. But we who are poor
    and ignorant idiots, what can we do to correspond to his immense
    goodness, and to be saved?” St.&nbsp;Bonaventure answered; “If God
    were to bestow on any one no other talents besides the grace of
    loving him, this alone suffices, and is every spiritual treasure,”
    B.&nbsp;Giles said,—“Can a dull idiot love God as perfectly as a
    great scholar?” St.&nbsp;Bonaventure replied: “A poor old woman
    may love him more than the most learned master and doctor in
    theology.” At this brother Giles, in a sudden fervor and
    jubilation of spirit, went into a garden, and standing at a gate
    toward the city (of Rome) he looked that way, and cried out with a
    loud voice,—“Come, the poorest, most simple, and most illiterate
    old woman, love the Lord our God, and you may attain to a higher
    degree of eminence and happiness than brother Bonaventure with all
    his learning.”<a id="c14_1k"> </a>After this he fell into an
    ecstasy, in which he continued in sweet contemplation without
    motion for the space of three hours.<a
      href="#fn_147"
      class="anchor">147</a></p>
  <p>
    Pope Clement&nbsp;IV. in 1265, nominated St.&nbsp;Bonaventure
    archbishop of York, being assured how agreeable he would be to
    that church, to the king of England, and his whole kingdom. But
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure having first by earnest prayer, begged that
    God would preserve him from so great a danger, went and cast
    himself at the feet of his holiness, and by tears and entreaties
    extorted from him a discharge from that burden. He held a general
    chapter at Paris in 1266; and in the next, which he assembled at
    Assisium, he ordered the triple salutation of the Blessed Virgin
    called the Angelus Domini to be recited every evening at six
    o’clock, to honor the incomprehensible mystery of the Incarnation,
    which ought to be the object of our perpetual praises and
    thanksgiving.</p>
  <p>
    In 1272, Theobald, the holy archdeacon of Liege, a native of
    Placentia, then absent in the Holy Land, was chosen pope, and took
    the name of Gregory&nbsp;X., a person of such eminent sanctity
    that a process has been set on foot for his canonization; and
    Benedict&nbsp;XIV., in 1745, ordered his name to be inserted in
    the Roman Martyrology. He was a man of an extraordinary reputation
    throughout all his life, for prudence in the conduct of his
    affairs; for courage, greatness of mind, and contempt of money;
    for devotion, clemency, and charity to the poor. He died on the
    10th of January, 1276, on his return from the council at Abruzzo
    in Tuscany, of which city he is the titular patron. Miracles have
    rendered his name illustrious. Bonaventure fearing this holy pope
    would compel him to accept of some ecclesiastical dignity, left
    Italy and went to Paris, where he wrote his Hexaëmeron or pious
    exposition of the creation, or work of six days. He had scarce
    finished it, when at Whitsuntide he received from the pope a brief
    by which he was nominated cardinal, and bishop of Albano, one of
    the six suffragans of Rome. His holiness added a precept to him to
    accept that double charge without alleging any pretext against it,
    and immediately to repair to Rome. He sent two nuncios to meet him
    on the road with the hat and other ensigns of his dignities. They
    found the saint reposing on his journey in a convent of his Order
    at Migel, four leagues from Florence, and employed in washing the
    dishes. He desired them to hang the cardinal’s hat on the bough of
    a tree, because he could not decently take it in his hands, and
    left them to walk in the garden till he had finished his work.
    Then taking up the hat he went to the nuncios, and paid them the
    respect due to their character. Gregory&nbsp;X. came from Orvietto
    to Florence, and there meeting Bonaventure ordained him bishop
    with his own hands; then ordered him to prepare himself to speak
    in the general council which he had called to meet at Lyons for
    the reunion of the Greeks.</p>
  <p>
    The emperor Michael Palæologus had made proposals to pope
    Clement&nbsp;IV. for a union. Pope Gregory&nbsp;X. zealously
    pursued this affair. Joseph, patriarch of Constantinople, made a
    violent opposition, but was obliged by the emperor to retire into
    a monastery. To bring this affair to a happy conclusion,
    Gregory&nbsp;X. invited the Greeks to come to the general council
    which he assembled at Lyons for this very purpose, and also to
    concert measures for pushing on a war for the recovery of the Holy
    Land, which the pope promoted with all his might. This was the
    fourteenth general council and the second of Lyons. At it were
    present five hundred bishops, seventy abbots, James king of
    Arragon, and the ambassadors of the emperor Michael and of other
    Christian princes. St.&nbsp;Thomas of Aquin died on the road to
    this synod.<a id="c14_1l"> </a>St.&nbsp;Bonaventure accompanied
    the pope through Milan to it, and arrived at Lyons in November,
    though the council was only opened on the 7th of
    May,&nbsp;1274.<a
      href="#fn_148"
      class="anchor">148</a>
    Bonaventure sat on the pope’s right hand, and first harangued the
    assembly. Between the second and third sessions he held his last
    general chapter of his Order, in which he abdicated the office of
    general. He found leisure to preach, and he established at Lyons a
    pious confraternity called Del Gonfalone, which he had formerly
    instituted at Rome. In it pious persons associated themselves in
    certain daily devotions, under the patronage of the mother of God.
    The deputies of the Greeks being arrived at Lyons,
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure was ordered by the pope to confer with them.
    They were charmed with his sweetness, and convinced by his
    reasoning, and they acquiesced in every point. In thanksgiving the
    pope sung mass on the feast of SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul, and the
    gospel was sung first in Latin, then in Greek. After this
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure preached on the unity of faith. Then the
    creed was sung first in Latin, then in Greek, and as a seal of the
    reunion of the two Churches, those words were thrice repeated:
    “Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son.”<a id="c14_1m">
    </a>In memory of this solemn function two crosses are placed on
    the high altar of the metropolitan church of St.&nbsp;John at
    Lyons.<a
      href="#fn_149"
      class="anchor">149</a>
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure was taken ill after this session;
    nevertheless he assisted at the fourth, in which the Logothete or
    high chancellor of Constantinople abjured the schism. But the next
    day the saint’s strength began entirely to fail him, insomuch that
    he was no longer able to attend business. From that time he gave
    himself up entirely to his private devotions, and the constant
    amiable serenity of his countenance demonstrated the holy peace
    and joy of his soul in those most awful moments. The pope himself
    gave him extreme unction, as is attested by an inscription which
    hath been preserved in the same chamber in which he died, to our
    times. The saint kept his eyes constantly fixed on a crucifix, and
    expired in great tranquillity on the 14th of July, in the year
    1274, of his age the fifty-third. The pope and the whole council
    solemnized his obsequies on the same day in the church of the
    Franciscans at Lyons. Peter of Tarentaise, a Dominican friar,
    cardinal and bishop of Ostia, afterward pope under the name of
    Innocent&nbsp;V., preached his funeral panegyric, in which he
    said,—“No one ever beheld him who did not conceive a great esteem
    and affection for him; and even strangers, by hearing him speak,
    were desirous to follow his counsel and advice; for he was gentle,
    affable, humble, pleasing to all, compassionate, prudent, chaste,
    and adorned with all virtues.”</p>
  <p>
    The body of St.&nbsp;Bonaventure was translated into the new
    church of the Franciscans on the 14th of March, 1434. King
    Charles&nbsp;VIII. founded their new convent at Lyons, at the foot
    of the castle of Pierre Incise, in 1494, with a rich chapel in
    which the saint’s remains were enshrined, except a part of the
    lower jaw, which that king caused to be conveyed to Fontainbleau,
    and it is now in the church of the Cordeliers in Paris: the bones
    of an arm are kept at Bagnarea, and a little bone at Venice.<a
    id="c14_1n"> </a>In 1562 the Calvinists plundered his shrine,
    burned his relics in the market-place, and scattered the ashes in
    the river Saone, as is related by the learned Jesuit Possevinus,
    who was then at Lyons.<a
      href="#fn_150"
      class="anchor">150</a>
    They stabbed to death the guardian with a Catholic captain whom
    they had made prisoner; they burned the archives of the library
    and set fire to the convent. The saint’s head and some other
    relics escaped the fury of the rebels by having been concealed.
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure was canonized by Sixtus&nbsp;IV. in 1482.
    Sixtus&nbsp;V. enrolled his name among the doctors of the Church,
    in the same manner as Pius&nbsp;V. had done that of
    St.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas. The acts of his canonization record
    several approved miracles wrought by his intercession. The city of
    Lyons, in 1628, being grievously afflicted with the plague, the
    raging distemper began to cease from the time in which certain
    relics of our saint were devoutly carried in procession. That and
    other cities have experienced the divine mercy in like manner, in
    several other public calamities, by invoking
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure’s intercession. Charles of Orleans, father of
    Louis&nbsp;XII. king of France, was taken prisoner by the English
    in the battle of Agincourt, in 1425. During his captivity he fell
    ill of a fever, under which no human remedies gave him any relief.
    The more desperate his situation appeared, with the more
    earnestness he set himself to implore the patronage of
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure, and a perfect recovery was the recompense of
    his devotion.<a id="c14_1o"> </a>In gratitude, as soon as he was
    set at liberty, he went to Lyons to offer up his thanksgivings and
    prayers at the tomb of the saint, on which he bestowed magnificent
    presents.<a
      href="#fn_151"
      class="anchor">151</a></p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Bonaventure, this great master of a spiritual life,
    places not the perfection of Christian virtue so much in the more
    heroic exercises of a religious state as in the performing well
    our ordinary actions.<a id="c14_1p"> </a>“The best perfection of a
    religious man,” says he, “is to do common things in a perfect
    manner.<a
      href="#fn_152"
      class="anchor">152</a>
    A&nbsp;constant fidelity in small things is a great and heroic
    virtue.” It is a continual crucifixion of self-love and all the
    passions; a complete sacrifice of all our actions, moments, and
    affections, and the entire reign of God’s grace throughout our
    whole lives. Quintilian lays it down for the great rule in forming
    an orator, that he accustom himself never to write or speak
    carelessly even on the most trifling subject or in common
    conversation, but that he study always to express himself in the
    most proper manner possible; with far greater diligence ought
    every one to strive to perform all even the meanest of his actions
    in the most perfect manner, and to improve every grace, every
    moment of time to advance in virtue.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;CAMILLUS DE&nbsp;LELLIS,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born in 1550 at Bacchianico in Abruzzo, in the kingdom of
    Naples. He lost his mother in his infancy, and six years after his
    father, who was a gentleman, and had been an officer, first in the
    Neapolitan and afterward in the French troops in Italy. Camillus
    having learned only to read and write, entered himself young in
    the army, and served first in the Venetian, and afterward in the
    Neapolitan troops, till, in 1574, his company was disbanded. He
    had contracted so violent a passion for cards and gaming, that he
    sometimes lost even necessaries.<a id="c14_2a"> </a>All playing at
    lawful games for exorbitant sums, and absolutely all games of
    hazard for considerable sums are forbidden by the law of nature,
    by the imperial or civil law,<a
      href="#fn_153"
      class="anchor">153</a>
    by the severest laws of all Christian or civilized nations, and by
    the canons of the Church.<a
      href="#fn_154"
      class="anchor">154</a>
    No contract is justifiable in which neither reason nor proportion
    is observed. Nor can it be consistent with the natural law of
    justice for a plan to stake any sum on blind chance, or to expose,
    without a reasonable equivalent or necessity, so much of his own
    or antagonist’s money, that the loss would notably distress
    himself or any other person. Also many other sins are inseparable
    from a spirit of gaming, which springs from avarice, is so
    hardened as to rejoice in the loss of others, and is the source
    and immediate occasion of many other vices. The best remedy for
    this vice is, that those who are infected with it be obliged, or
    at least exhorted, to give whatever they have won to the poor.</p>
  <p>
    Camillus was insensible of the evils attending gaming, till
    necessity compelled him to open his eyes; for he at length was
    reduced to such straits, that for a subsistence he was obliged to
    drive two asses, and to work at a building which belonged to the
    Capuchin friars. The divine mercy had not abandoned him through
    all his wanderings, but had often visited him with strong interior
    calls to penance. A&nbsp;moving exhortation which the guardian of
    the Capuchins one day made him, completed his conversion.
    Ruminating on it as he rode from him upon his business, he at
    length alighted, fell on his knees, and vehemently striking his
    breast, with many tears and loud groans deplored his past
    unthinking sinful life, and cried to heaven for mercy. This
    happened in February in the year 1575, the twenty-fifth of his
    age; and from that time to his last breath he never interrupted
    his penitential course. He made an essay of a novitiate both among
    the Capuchins and the Grey Friars, but could not be admitted to
    his religious profession among either on account of a running sore
    in one of his legs, which was judged incurable. Therefore leaving
    his own country he went to Rome, and there served the sick in
    St.&nbsp;James’s hospital of incurables four years with great
    fervor. He wore a knotty hair shirt, and a rough brass girdle next
    his skin; watched night and day about the sick, especially those
    that were dying, with the most scrupulous attention. He was most
    zealous to suggest to them devout acts of virtue and to procure
    them every spiritual help. Fervent humble prayer was the assiduous
    exercise of his soul, and he received the holy communion every
    Sunday and holiday, making use of St.&nbsp;Philip Neri for his
    confessarius. The provisors or administrators having been
    witnesses to his charity, prudence, and piety, after some time
    appointed him director of the hospital.</p>
  <p>
    Camillus grieving to see the sloth of hired servants in attending
    the sick, formed a project of associating certain pious persons
    for that office who should be desirous to devote themselves to it
    out of a motive of fervent charity. He found proper persons so
    disposed, but met with great obstacles in the execution of his
    design. With a view of rendering himself more useful in
    spiritually assisting the sick, he took a resolution to prepare
    himself to receive holy orders. For this purpose he went through a
    course of studies with incredible alacrity and ardor, and received
    all his orders from Thomas Goldwell, bishop of St.&nbsp;Asaph’s,
    suffragan to cardinal Savelli, the bishop vicegerent in Rome,
    under pope Gregory&nbsp;XIII. A&nbsp;certain gentleman of Rome
    named Firmo Calmo, gave the saint six hundred Roman sequines of
    gold (about two hundred and fifty pounds sterling), which he put
    out for an annuity of thirty-six sequines a year during his life;
    this amounting to a competent patrimony for the title of his
    ordination, required by the council of Trent and the laws of the
    diocess. The same pious gentleman, besides frequent great
    benefactions during his life, bequeathed his whole estate real and
    personal on Camillus’s hospital at his death. The saint was
    ordained priest at Whitsuntide in 1584, and being nominated to
    serve a little chapel called our Lady’s <i>ad miracula</i>, he
    quitted the direction of the hospital. Before the close of the
    same year he laid the foundation of his congregation for serving
    the sick, giving to those who were admitted into it a long black
    garment with a black cloth for their habit. The saint prescribed
    them certain short rules, and they went every day to the great
    hospital of the Holy Ghost, where they served the sick with so
    much affection, piety, and diligence, that it was visible to all
    who saw them, that they considered Christ himself as lying sick or
    wounded in his members.</p>
  <p>
    They made the beds of the patients, paid them every office of
    charity, and by their short pathetic exhortations disposed them
    for the last sacraments, and a happy death. The founder had
    powerful adversaries and great difficulties to struggle with; but
    by confidence in God he conquered them all. In 1585 his friends
    hired for him a large house, and the success of his undertaking
    encouraged him to extend further his pious views; for he ordained
    that the members of his congregation should bind themselves by the
    obligation of their institute, to serve persons infected with the
    plague, prisoners, and those who lie dying in private houses.</p>
  <p id="c14_2c">
    Sickness is often the most severe and grievous of all trials,
    whence the devil made it his last assault in tempting Job.<a
      href="#fn_155"
      class="anchor">155</a>
    It is a time in which a Christian stands in need of the greatest
    constancy and fortitude; yet through the weakness of nature, is
    generally the least able to keep his heart united with God, and
    usually never stands more in need of spiritual comfort and
    assistance. The state of sickness is always a visitation of God,
    who by it knocks at the door of our heart, and puts us in mind of
    death; it is the touchstone of patience, and the school or rather
    the harvest of penance, resignation, divine love, and every
    virtue. Yet by a most fatal abuse is this mercy often lost and
    perverted by sloth, impatience, sensuality, and forwardness. Those
    who in time of health were backward in exercising fervent acts of
    faith, hope, charity, contrition, &amp;c., in sickness are still
    more indisposed for practices with which they are unacquainted;
    and to their grievous misfortune sometimes pastors cannot
    sufficiently attend them, or have not a suitable address which
    will give them the key of their hearts, or teach them the art of
    insinuating into the souls of penitents the heroic sentiments and
    an interior relish of those essential virtues.</p>
  <p>
    This consideration moved Camillus to make it the chief end of his
    new establishment, to afford or procure the sick all spiritual
    succor, discreetly to suggest to them short pathetic acts of
    compunction and other virtues, to read by them, and to pray for
    them.<a id="c14_2d"> </a>For this end he furnished his priests
    with proper books of devotion, especially on penance and on the
    sufferings of Christ; and he taught them to have always at hand
    the most suitable ejaculations extracted from the psalms and other
    devotions.<a
      href="#fn_156"
      class="anchor">156</a>
    But dying persons were the principal object of our saint’s pious
    zeal and charity. A&nbsp;man’s last moments are the most precious
    of his whole life; and are of infinite importance; as on them
    depends his eternal lot.<a id="c14_2e"> </a>Then the devil useth
    his utmost efforts to ruin a soul, and <i>cometh down, having
    great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time</i>.<a
      href="#fn_157"
      class="anchor">157</a>
    The saint therefore redoubled his earnestness to afford every
    spiritual help to persons who seemed in danger of death. He put
    them early in mind to settle their temporal concerns, that their
    thoughts might be afterward employed entirely on the affair of
    their soul. He advised those friends not to approach them too
    much, whose sight or immoderate grief could only disturb or
    afflict them. He disposed them to receive the last sacraments by
    the most perfect acts of compunction, resignation, faith, hope,
    and divine love; and he taught them to make death a voluntary
    sacrifice of themselves to the divine will, and in satisfaction
    for sin; of which it is the punishment. He instructed them to
    conjure their blessed Redeemer by the bitter anguish which his
    divine heart felt in the garden and on the cross, and by his
    prayer with a loud voice and tears, in which he deserved to be
    heard for his reverence, that he would show them mercy, and give
    them the grace to offer up their death in union with his most
    precious death, and to receive their soul as he with his last
    breath recommended his own divine soul into the hands of his
    heavenly Father, and with it those of all his elect to the end of
    the world. He instituted prayers for all persons in their agony,
    or who were near their death.</p>
  <p>
    Every one was charmed at so perfect a project of charity, and all
    admired that such noble views and so great an undertaking should
    have been reserved to an obscure illiterate person. Pope
    Sixtus&nbsp;V. confirmed this congregation in 1586, and ordered
    that it should be governed by a triennial superior. Camillus was
    the first, and Roger, an Englishman, was one of his first
    companions. The church of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen was bestowed on
    him for the use of his congregation. In 1588 he was invited to
    Naples, and with twelve companions founded there a new house.
    Certain galleys having the plague on board were forbid to enter
    the harbor. Wherefore these pious <i>Servants of the sick</i> (for
    that was the name they took) went on board, and attended them; on
    which occasion two of their number died of the pestilence, and
    were the first martyrs of charity in this holy institute.
    St.&nbsp;Camillus showed a like charity in Rome when a
    pestilential fever swept off great numbers, and again when that
    city was visited by a violent famine. In 1591 Gregory&nbsp;XV.
    erected this congregation into a religious Order, with all the
    privileges of the mendicant Order, and under the obligation of the
    four vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and perpetually serving
    the sick, even those infected with the plague; he forbade these
    religious men to pass to any other Order except that of the
    Carthusians. Pope Clement&nbsp;VIII. in 1592 and 1600 again
    confirmed this Order with additional privileges. Indeed the very
    end of this institution engaged all men to favor it; especially
    those who considered how many thousands die, even in the midst of
    priests, without sufficient help in preparing themselves for that
    dreadful hour which decides their eternity; what superficial
    confessions, what neglect in acts of contrition, charity,
    restitution, and other essential duties, are often to be feared;
    which grievous evils might be frequently remedied by the assiduity
    of well qualified ministers.</p>
  <p id="c14_2f">
    Among many abuses and dangerous evils which the zeal of
    St.&nbsp;Camillus prevented, his attention to every circumstance
    relating to the care of dying persons soon made him discover that
    in hospitals many are buried alive, of which Cicatello relates
    several examples,<a
      href="#fn_158"
      class="anchor">158</a>
    particularly of one buried in a vault, who was found walking about
    in it when the next corpse was brought to be there interred. Hence
    the saint ordered his religious to continue the prayers for souls
    yet in their agony for a quarter of an hour after they seem to
    have drawn their last breath, and not to suffer their faces to be
    covered so soon as is usual, by which means those that are not
    dead are stifled.<a id="c14_2g"> </a>This precaution is most
    necessary in cases of drowning, apoplexies, and such accidents and
    distempers which arise from mere obstructions or some sudden
    revolution of humors.<a
      href="#fn_159"
      class="anchor">159</a>
    St.&nbsp;Camillus showed still a far greater solicitude to provide
    all comforts and assistance for the souls of those that are sick,
    suggesting frequent short pathetic aspirations, showing them a
    crucifix, examining their past confessions and present
    dispositions, and making them exhortations with such unction and
    fervor that his voice seemed like a shrill trumpet, and pierced
    the hearts of all who heard him. He encouraged his disciples to
    these duties with words of fire. He did not love to hear anything
    spoken unless divine charity made part of the subject; and if he
    had a sermon in which it was not mentioned, he would call the
    discourse a gold ring without a stone.</p>
  <p>
    He was himself afflicted with many corporal infirmities, as a sore
    in his leg for forty-six years; a rupture for thirty-eight years
    which he got by serving the sick; two callous sores in the sole of
    one of his feet, which gave him great pain; violent nephritic
    colics, and for a long time before he died, a loss of appetite.
    Under this complication of diseases he would not suffer any one to
    wait on him, but sent all his brethren to serve poor sick persons.
    When he was not able to stand he would creep out of his bed, even
    in the night, by the sides of the beds, and crawl from one patient
    to another to exhort them to acts of virtue, and see if they
    wanted anything. He slept very little, spending great part of the
    night in prayer and in serving the sick. He used often to repeat
    with St.&nbsp;Francis: “So great is the happiness which
    I&nbsp;hope for, that all pain and suffering is a pleasure.” His
    friars are not obliged to recite the Church office unless they are
    in holy Orders; but confess and communicate every Sunday and great
    holiday, have every day one hour’s meditation, hear mass, and say
    the litany, beads, and other devotions. The holy founder was most
    scrupulously exact in every word and ceremony of the holy mass,
    and of the divine office. He despised himself to a degree that
    astonished all who knew him. He laid down the generalship in 1607,
    that he might be more at leisure to serve the poor. He founded
    religious houses at Bologna, Milan, Genoa, Florence, Ferrara,
    Messina, Palermo, Mantua, Viterbo, Bocchiano, Theate, Burgonono,
    Sinuessa, and other places. He had sent several of his friars into
    Hungary, and to all other places which in his time were afflicted
    with the plague. When Nola was visited with that calamity in 1600,
    the bishop constituted Camillus his vicar general, and it is
    incredible what succors the sick received from him and his
    companions, of whom five died of that distemper. God testified his
    approbation of the saint’s zeal by the spirit of prophecy and the
    gift of miracles, on several occasions, and by many heavenly
    communications and favors.</p>
  <p>
    He assisted at the fifth general chapter of his Order in Rome in
    1613, and after it, with the new general, visited the houses in
    Lombardy, giving them his last exhortations, which were everywhere
    received with tears. At Genoa he was extremely ill, but being a
    little better, duke Doria Tursi sent him in his rich galley to
    Civita Vecchia, whence he was conveyed in a litter to Rome. He
    recovered so as to be able to finish the visitation of his
    hospitals, but soon relapsed, and his life was despaired of by the
    physicians. Hearing this, he said,—<i>I&nbsp;rejoice in what hath
    been told me: We shall go into the house of the Lord.</i> He
    received the viaticum from the hands of cardinal Ginnasio,
    protector of his Order, and said with many tears,—“O&nbsp;Lord,
    I&nbsp;confess I&nbsp;am the most wretched of sinners, most
    undeserving of thy favor; but save me by thy infinite goodness. My
    hope is placed in thy divine mercy through thy precious blood.”
    Though he had lived in the greatest purity of conscience ever
    since his conversion, he had been accustomed to go every day to
    confession with great compunction and many tears. When he received
    the extreme unction he made a moving exhortation to his religious
    brethren, and having foretold that he should die that evening, he
    expired on the 14th of July, 1614, being sixty-five years one
    month and twenty days old. He was buried near the high altar in
    St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen’s church; but upon the miracles which were
    authentically approved, his remains were taken up and laid under
    the altar; they were enshrined after he was beatified in 1742, and
    in 1746 he was solemnly canonized by Benedict&nbsp;XIV. See the
    life of St.&nbsp;Camillus by Cicatello his disciple, and the acts
    of his canonization with those of SS.&nbsp;Fidelis of Sigmaringa,

    ST.&nbsp;HENRY&nbsp;II. EMPEROR.</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    From his authentic life, published by Surius and D’Andilly, and
    from the historians Sigebert, Glaber, Dithmar, Lambert of
    Aschaffenburg, Leo Urbevetanus in his double chronicle of the
    popes and emperors, in Deliciæ Eruditor. t.&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2.
    Aventin’s Annals of Bavaria,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1024.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Henry, surnamed the Pious and the Lame, was son of Henry,
    duke of Bavaria, and of Gisella, daughter of Conrad, king of
    Burgundy, and was born in 972. He was descended from Henry, Duke
    of Bavaria, son of the emperor Henry the Fowler, and brother of
    Otho the Great, consequently our saint was near akin to the three
    first Emperors who bore the name of Otho. St.&nbsp;Wolfgang, the
    Bishop of Ratisbon, being a prelate the most eminent in all
    Germany for learning, piety, and zeal, our young prince was put
    under his tuition, and by his excellent instructions and example
    he made from his infancy wonderful progress in learning and in the
    most perfect practice of Christian virtue. The death of his dear
    master and spiritual guide, which happened in 994, was to him a
    most sensible affliction.<a id="c15_1a"> </a>In the following year
    he succeeded his father in the duchy of Bavaria, and in 1002, upon
    the death of his cousin Otho&nbsp;III. he was chosen emperor.<a
      href="#fn_160"
      class="anchor">160</a>
    He was the same year crowned king of Germany at Mentz, by the
    archbishop of that city. He had always before his eyes the extreme
    dangers to which they are exposed who move on the precipice of
    power, and that all human things are like edifices of sand, which
    every breath of time threatens to overturn or deface; he studied
    the extent and importance of the obligations which attended his
    dignity; and by the assiduous practice of humiliations, prayer,
    and pious meditation, he maintained in his heart the necessary
    spirit of humility and holy fear, and was enabled to bear the tide
    of prosperity and honor with a constant evenness of temper.
    Sensible of the end for which alone he was exalted by God to the
    highest temporal dignity, he exerted his most strenuous endeavors
    to promote in all things the divine honor, the exaltation of the
    Church, and the peace and happiness of his people.</p>
  <p>
    Soon after his accession to the throne he resigned the dukedom of
    Bavaria, which he bestowed on his brother-in-law Henry, surnamed
    Senior. He procured a national council of the bishops of all his
    dominions, which was assembled at Dortmund, in Westphalia, in
    1005, in order to regulate many points of discipline; and to
    enforce a strict observance of the holy canons. It was owing to
    his zeal that many provincial synods were also held for the same
    purpose in several parts of the empire. He was himself present at
    that of Frankfort in 1006, and at another of Bamberg in 1011. The
    protection he owed his subjects engaged him sometimes in wars, in
    all which he was successful. By his prudence, courage, and
    clemency, he stifled a rebellion at home in the beginning of his
    reign, and without striking a stroke compelled the malecontents
    to lay down their arms at his feet, which when they had done he
    received them into favor. Two years after he quelled another
    rebellion in Italy, when Ardovinus or Hardwic, a Lombard lord, had
    caused himself to be crowned king at Milan. This nobleman, after
    his defeat, made his submission, and obtained his pardon. When he
    had afterward revolted a second time, the emperor marched again
    into Italy, vanquished him in battle, and deprived him of his
    territories, but did not take away his life, and Ardovinus became
    a monk. After this second victory, St.&nbsp;Henry went in triumph
    to Rome, where, in 1014, he was crowned emperor with great
    solemnity by pope Benedict&nbsp;VIII.<a id="c15_1b"> </a>On that
    occasion, to give a proof of his devotion to the holy see, he
    confirmed to it, by an ample diploma, the donation made by several
    former emperors, of the sovereignty of Rome and the exarchate of
    Ravenna:<a
      href="#fn_161"
      class="anchor">161</a>
    and after a short stay at Rome, took leave of the pope, and in his
    return to Germany kept the Easter holydays at Pavia; then he
    visited the monastery of Cluni, on which he bestowed the imperial
    globe of gold which the pope had given him, and a gold crown
    enriched with precious stones. He paid his devotions in other
    monasteries on the road, leaving in every one of them some rich
    monument of his piety and liberality. But the most acceptable
    offering which he made to God was the fervor and purity of
    affection with which he renewed the consecration of his soul to
    God in all places where he came, especially at the foot of the
    altars. Travelling through Liege and Tries he arrived at Bamberg,
    in which city he had lately founded a rich episcopal see, and had
    built a most stately cathedral in honor of St.&nbsp;Peter, which
    pope John&nbsp;XVIII. took a journey into Germany to consecrate in
    1019. The emperor obtained of this pope, by an honorable embassy,
    the confirmation of this and all his other pious foundations. For
    he built and endowed other churches with the two monasteries at
    Bamberg, and made the like foundations in several other places;
    thus extending his zealous views to promote the divine honor and
    the relief of the poor to the end of time. Bruno, bishop of
    Ausburg, the emperor’s brother, Henry, duke of Bavaria, and other
    relations of the saint complained loudly that he employed his
    patrimony on such religious foundations, and the duke of Bavaria
    and some others took up arms against him in 1010; but he defeated
    them in the field; then pardoned the princes engaged in the
    revolt, and restored to them Bavaria and their other territories
    which he had seized.</p>
  <p>
    The idolatrous inhabitants of Poland and Sclavonia had some time
    before laid waste the diocess of Meersburg, and destroyed that and
    several other churches. St.&nbsp;Henry marched against those
    barbarous nations, and having put his army under the protection
    of the holy martyrs St.&nbsp;Laurence, St.&nbsp;George, and
    St.&nbsp;Adrian, who are said to have been seen in the battle
    fighting before him, he defeated the infidels. He had made a vow
    to re-establish the see of Meersburg in case he obtained the
    victory, and he caused all his army to communicate the day before
    the battle which was fought near that city. The barbarians were
    seized with a panic fear in the beginning of the action, and
    submitted at discretion. The princes of Bohemia rebelled, but were
    easily brought back to their duty. The victorious emperor
    munificently repaired and restored the episcopal sees of
    Hildesheim, Magdeburg, Strasburg, Misnia, and Meersburg, and made
    all Poland, Bohemia, and Moravia tributary to the empire. He
    procured holy preachers to be sent to instruct the Bohemians and
    Polanders in the faith. Those have been mistaken who pretend that
    St.&nbsp;Henry converted St.&nbsp;Stephen, king of Hungary; for
    that prince was born of Christian parents. But our saint promoted
    his zealous endeavors, and had a great share in his apostolic
    undertakings for the conversion of his people.</p>
  <p id="c15_1c">
    The protection of Christendom, and especially of the holy see,
    obliged St.&nbsp;Henry to lead an army to the extremity of
    Italy,<a
      href="#fn_162"
      class="anchor">162</a>
    where he vanquished the conquering Saracens, with their allies the
    Greeks, and drove them out of Italy, left a governor in the
    provinces which he had recovered, and suffered the Normans to
    enjoy the territories which they had then wrested from the
    infidels, but restrained them from turning their arms towards
    Naples or Benevento. He came back by Mount Cassino, and was
    honorably received at Rome; but during his stay in that city, by
    a painful contraction of the sinews in his thigh, became lame and
    continued so till his death.<a id="c15_1d"> </a>He passed by
    Cluni, and in the duchy of Luxemburg had an interview with Robert,
    king of France, son and successor of Hugh Capet.<a
      href="#fn_163"
      class="anchor">163</a>
    It had been agreed that, to avoid all disputes of pre-eminence,
    the two princes should hold their conference in boats on the river
    Meuse, which as Glaber writes, was at that time the boundary that
    parted their dominions. But Henry, impatient to embrace and cement
    a friendship with that great and virtuous king, paid the first
    visit to Robert in his tent, and afterward received him in his
    own. A&nbsp;war had broken out between these two princes in 1006,
    and Henry gave the French a great overthrow; but being desirous
    only to govern his dominions in peace, he entered into
    negotiations which produced a lasting peace. In this interview,
    which was held in 1023, the conference of the two princes turned
    on the most important affairs of Church and State, and on the best
    means of advancing piety, religion, and the welfare of their
    subjects. After the most cordial demonstrations of sincere
    friendship they took leave of each other, and St.&nbsp;Henry
    proceeded to Verdun and Metz. He made frequent progresses through
    his dominions only to promote piety, enrich all the churches,
    relieve the poor, make a strict inquiry into all public disorders
    and abuses, and prevent unjust usurpations and oppressions. He
    desired to have no other heir on earth but Christ in his members,
    and wherever he went he spread the odor of his piety, and his
    liberalities on the poor.</p>
  <p>
    It is incredible how attentive he was to the smallest affairs
    amidst the multiplicity of business which attends the government
    of the state; nothing seemed to escape him; and whilst he was most
    active and vigilant in every duty which he owed to the public, he
    did not forget that the care of his own soul and the regulation of
    his interior was his first and most essential obligation. He was
    sensible that pride and vain-glory are the most dangerous of all
    vices, and that they are the most difficult to be discovered, and
    the last that are vanquished in the spiritual warfare; that
    humility is the very foundation of all true virtue, and our
    progress in it the measure of our advancement in Christian
    perfection. Therefore the higher he was exalted in worldly honors
    the more did he study to humble himself, and it is said of him,
    that never was greater humility seen under a diadem. He loved
    those persons best who most freely put him in mind of his
    mistakes, and these he was always most ready to confess, and to
    make for them the most ample reparation. Through misinformations,
    he for some time harbored coldness toward Saint Herebert
    archbishop of Cologne; but discovering the innocence and sanctity
    of that prelate, he fell at his feet, and would not rise till he
    had received his absolution and pardon. He banished flatterers
    from his presence, calling them the greatest pests of courts; for
    none can put such as affront on a man’s judgment and modesty, as
    to praise him to his face, but the base and most wicked of
    interested and designing men, who make use of this artifice to
    insinuate themselves into the favor of a prince, to abuse his
    weakness and credulity, and to make him the dupe of their
    injustices. He who listens to them exposes himself to many
    misfortunes and crimes, to the danger of the most foolish pride
    and vain-glory, and to the ridicule and scorn of his flatterers
    themselves; for a vanity that can publicly hear its own praises,
    openly unmasks itself to its confusion. The emperor Sigismund
    giving a flatterer a blow on the face, called his fulsome praise
    the greatest insult that had ever been offered him. St.&nbsp;Henry
    was raised by religion and humility above this abjectness of soul
    which reason itself teaches us to abhor and despise. By the
    assiduous mortification of the senses he kept his passions in
    subjection. For pleasure, unless we are guarded against its
    assaults, steals upon us by insensible degrees, smooths its
    passage to the heart by a gentle and insinuating address, and
    softens and disarms the soul of all its strength. Nor is it
    possible for us to triumph over unlawful sensual delights, unless
    we moderate and practise frequent self-denials with regard to
    lawful gratifications. The love of the world is a no less
    dangerous enemy, especially amidst honors and affluence; and
    created objects have this quality that they first seduce the
    heart, and then blind the understanding. By conversing always in
    heaven, St.&nbsp;Henry raised his affections so much above the
    earth as to escape this snare.</p>
  <p>
    Prayer seemed the chief delight and support of his soul;
    especially the public office of the Church. Assisting one day at
    this holy function at Strasburg, he so earnestly desired to remain
    always there to sing the divine praises among the devout canons of
    that Church, that, finding this impossible, he founded there a new
    canonry for one who should always perform that sacred duty in his
    name. In this spirit of devotion it has been established that the
    kings of France are canons of Strasburg, Lyons, and some other
    places; as in the former place the emperors, in the latter the
    dukes of Burgundy, were before them. The holy sacrament of the
    altar and sacrifice of the mass were the object of
    St.&nbsp;Henry’s most tender devotion. The blessed Mother of God
    he honored as his chief patroness, and among other exercises by
    which he recommended himself to her intercession, it was his
    custom, upon coming to any town, to spend a great part of the
    first night in watching and prayer in some church dedicated to God
    under her name, as at Rome in St.&nbsp;Mary Major. He had a
    singular devotion to the good angels and to all the saints. Though
    he lived in the world so as to be perfectly disengaged from it in
    heart and affection, it was his earnest desire entirely to
    renounce it long before his death, and he intended to pitch upon
    the abbey of St.&nbsp;Vanne, at Verdun, for the place of his
    retirement.<a id="c15_1e"> </a>But he was diverted from carrying
    this project into execution, by the advice of Richard the holy
    abbot of that house.<a
      href="#fn_164"
      class="anchor">164</a>
    He had married St.&nbsp;Cunegonda, but lived with her in perpetual
    chastity, to which they had mutually bound themselves by vow. It
    happened that the empress was falsely accused of incontinency, and
    St.&nbsp;Henry was somewhat moved by the slander; but she cleared
    herself by her oath, and by the ordeal trials, walking over twelve
    red hot plough-shares without hurt. Her husband severely condemned
    himself for his credulity, and made her the most ample
    satisfaction. In his last illness he recommended her to her
    relations and friends, declaring that he left her an untouched
    virgin. His health decayed some years before his death, which
    happened at the castle of Grone, near Halberstadt, in 1024, on the
    14th of July, toward the end of the fifty-second year of his life;
    he having reigned twenty-two years from his election, and ten
    years and five months from his coronation at Rome. His body was
    interred in the cathedral at Bamberg with the greatest pomp, and
    with the unfeigned tears of all his subjects. The great number of
    miracles by which God was pleased to declare his glory in heaven,
    procured his canonization, which was performed by
    Eugenius&nbsp;III., in 1152.<a id="c15_1f"> </a>His festival is

    ST.&nbsp;PLECHELM, B.&nbsp;C.
    APOSTLE&nbsp;OF&nbsp;GUELDERLAND.</h3>
  <p>
    He was by birth a noble English Saxon, but born in the southern
    part of Scotland; for Lothian and the rest of the Lowlands as far
    as Edinburgh Frith belonged for several ages to the Northumbrian
    English. Having received holy orders in his own country he made a
    pilgrimage to Rome, whence he returned home enriched with holy
    relics. Some time after, in company with the holy bishop
    St.&nbsp;Wiro, and St.&nbsp;Otger a deacon, he passed into those
    parts of Lower Germany which had not then received the light of
    faith. Having obtained the protection of Pepin, mayor of the
    palace in Austrasia, he converted the country now called
    Guelderland, Cleves, Juliers, and several neighboring provinces
    lying chiefly between the Rhine, the Wahal, and the Meuse. When he
    had planted the gospel there with great success he retired to
    St.&nbsp;Peter’s Mount near Ruremund, but continued to make
    frequent missions among the remaining infidels.<a id="c15_2a">
    </a>Prince Pepin, who though he had formerly fallen into adultery,
    led afterward a penitential and Christian holy life, went every
    year from his castle of Herstal to confess his sins to his holy
    pastor after the death of St.&nbsp;Wiro, which the author of
    St.&nbsp;Plechelm’s life relates in the following words.<a
      href="#fn_167"
      class="anchor">167</a>
    “Pepin, the king of the French (that is, mayor with royal
    authority), had him in great veneration, and every year, in the
    beginning of Lent, having laid aside his purple, went from his
    palace barefoot to the said mount of Peter where the saint lived,
    and took his advice how he ought to govern his kingdom according
    to the holy will and law of God, and by what means he might
    promote the faith of Christ and every advantage of virtue. There
    also having made the confession of his sins to the high priest of
    the Lord, and received penance, he washed away with his tears the
    offences which through human frailty he had contracted.”
    F.&nbsp;Bosch, the Bollandist, observes, this prince must have
    been Pepin, surnamed of Herstal, or the Fat, who, though he never
    enjoyed the title of king, reigned in Austrasia with regal power,
    and with equal piety and valor. He died in 714, in the castle of
    Jopil on the Meuse, near Liege, which was his paternal estate,
    St.&nbsp;Pepin of Landen his grandfather being son of Carloman,
    the first mayor of his family, grandson of Charles count of Hesbay
    near Liege, the descendant of Ferreol, formerly præfectus-prætorio
    of the Gauls. St.&nbsp;Plechelm survived Pepin of Herstel
    seventeen years, is called by Bollandus bishop of Oldenzel and
    Ruremund, and died on the 15th of July, 732. He was buried in our
    lady’s chapel in the church, on the mountain of St.&nbsp;Peter,
    now called of St.&nbsp;Odilia, near Ruremund. His relics were
    honored with many miracles. The principal portion of them is now
    possessed by the collegiate church of Oldenzel, in the province of
    Over-Yssel, part at Ruremund. His name is famous in the Belgic and
    other Martyrologies. His ancient life testifies that he was
    ordained bishop in his own country before he undertook a
    missionary life. Bede, in the year 731, mentions Pechthelm, who
    having been formerly a disciple of St.&nbsp;Aldhelm, in the
    kingdom of the West-Saxons, returning to his own country was
    ordained bishop to preach the gospel with more authority. He
    afterward fixed his see at Candida Casa, now a parliamentary town
    of Galloway in Scotland, called Whitehorn.<a id="c15_2b"> </a>The
    Bollandists in several parts of their work contend this Pechthelm
    to have been a different person from St.&nbsp;Plechelm, whom

    the other, somewhat elder according to Bede, was in North-Britain
    at Candida Casa; though Antony Pagi<a

    ST.&nbsp;SWITHIN OR SWITHUN,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    BISHOP AND PATRON OF WINCHESTER.</p>
  <p>
    This city had been famous in the time of the Romans and a station
    of their troops, being called by Ptolemy and Antoninus, Venta. It
    became afterwards the chief seat of the West-Saxon kings. Among
    these, Kynegils, having received the faith about the year 635,
    gave to St.&nbsp;Birinus the city of Dorcester for his episcopal
    see, but founded a church at Winchester, which was dedicated by
    St.&nbsp;Birinus to St.&nbsp;Peter, according to the Saxon
    Chronicle, or to the Holy Trinity, according to Thomas Rudburn.
    Wini, the third bishop of the West-Saxons, fixed his see at
    Winchester, and this church became one of the most flourishing
    cathedrals of all Britain. St.&nbsp;Swithun, called in the
    original Saxon language Swithum, received in this church the
    clerical tonsure, and put on the monastic habit in the Old
    Monastery, which had been founded by king Kynegils. He was of
    noble parentage, passed his youth in innocent simplicity, and in
    the study of grammar, philosophy, and the holy scriptures. He was
    an accomplished model of all virtues when he was promoted to holy
    orders by Helinstan or Helmstan, bishop of Winchester.</p>
  <p>
    Being ordained priest, he was made provost or dean of the Old
    Monastery. His learning, piety, and prudence, moved Egbert, king
    of the West-Saxons, to make him his priest, under which title the
    saint subscribed a charter granted to the abbey of Croyland in
    833. That great prince committed to his care the education of his
    son Ethelwolf, and made use of his counsels in the government of
    his kingdom. A&nbsp;degeneracy of manners had crept into the
    courts of the Merceians and Northumbrians, and their government
    was weakened by intestine divisions and several revolutions.
    Egbert having first vanquished Swithred, king of the East-Saxons,
    and added his kingdom to his own, upon several provocations,
    invaded Mercia, and conquered it in 823, but soon after restored
    Withlaf, whom he had expelled, to the throne of that kingdom on
    condition he should hold the crown of him, and pay him an annual
    tribute. He treated in the same manner Eandred, the last king of
    the Northumbers, and made him tributary, after he had with a great
    army laid waste that province. The kingdom of the East Angles
    submitted to him about the same time with Mercia, with which it
    had been long engaged in war and was thereby reduced to extreme
    poverty. Kent being at that time tributary to Mercia, it fell also
    to the share of the conqueror. After this, Egbert assembled all
    the great men of his kingdom, both clergy and laity, in a council
    at Winchester, in which he enacted that this kingdom should ever
    after be called England, and all his subjects Englishmen. At the
    same time he was again crowned, and from that year, 829, was
    styled king of England. Thus were the names of Saxons and Jutes
    abolished among us, and an end was put to the heptarchy, or
    division of this nation into seven kingdoms, which began to be
    formed by Hengist in 457, when he took the title of king, seven
    years after his arrival in this island, in 449. Towards the latter
    end of Egbert’s reign the Danes first began to infest England.<a
    id="c15_3a"> </a>This general name historians give to those shoals
    of pirates which were composed not only of Danes, but also of
    Norwegians, Goths, Sweones or Swedes, and Vandals, as Eginhard,
    Henry of Huntingdon, and others assure us.<a
      href="#fn_170"
      class="anchor">170</a></p>
  <p>
    King Egbert reigned thirty-seven years over the West Saxons, and
    nine years over all England, dying in the year 838, or according
    to others in 837.<a id="c15_3b"> </a>Ethelwolf, his only surviving
    son, had been educated in piety and learning under the care of
    St.&nbsp;Swithin, then provost of the Old Monastery in
    Winchester,<a
      href="#fn_171"
      class="anchor">171</a>
    and had been ordained subdeacon by bishop Helmstan, as Rudburn,
    Huntingdon, and others relate. But upon the death of his elder
    brother, whose name is not known, he was dispensed with by pope
    Leo to marry, and returning again to a secular life, helped his
    father in his wars, and after his death was advanced to the
    throne. He married Osberge, a lady of remarkable piety, and had
    four sons by her, Ethelbald, Ethelbright, Ethelred, and Alfred. He
    governed his kingdom by the prudent advice of Alstan, bishop of
    Shirborne, in temporal affairs; and by that of St.&nbsp;Swithin in
    ecclesiastical matters, especially those which concerned his own
    soul. And though the king was of a slow disposition, yet by the
    assistance of these worthy counsellors, he reigned prudently and
    happily; the Danes were often repulsed, and many noble designs for
    the good of the Church and state were begun, and prosperously
    executed. Bearing always the greatest reverence to
    St.&nbsp;Swithin, whom he called his master and teacher, he
    procured him, upon the death of Helmstan, to be chosen bishop of
    Winchester, to which see he was consecrated by Ceolnoth,
    archbishop of Canterbury, in 852.<a id="c15_3c"> </a>Herne has
    given us the profession of faith which he made on that occasion,
    according to custom, in the hands of the archbishop.<a
      href="#fn_172"
      class="anchor">172</a>
    William of Malmesbury says, that though this good bishop was a
    rich treasure of all virtues, those in which he took most delight
    were humility and charity to the poor; and in the discharge of his
    episcopal functions he omitted nothing belonging to a true pastor.
    He built divers churches, and repaired others; and made his
    journeys on foot, accompanied with his clerks, and often by night
    to avoid ostentation. Being to dedicate any church, he with all
    humility used to go barefoot to the place. His feasting was not
    with the rich, but with the needy and the poor. His mouth was
    always open to invite sinners to repentance, and to admonish those
    that stood to beware of falling. He was most severe to himself,
    and abstemious in his diet, never eating to satisfy his appetite,
    but barely to sustain nature; and as to sleep, he admitted no more
    than what after long watching and much labor was absolutely
    necessary. He was always delighted with psalms and spiritual
    canticles, and in conversation would bear no discourse but what
    tended to edification.</p>
  <p>
    By his counsel and advice king Ethelwolf, in a Mycel synod or
    great council of the nation in 854, enacted a new law by which he
    gave the tithes or tenth part of his land throughout the kingdom
    to the Church, exempt and free from all taxations and burthens,
    with an obligation of prayers in all churches for ever for his own
    soul, on every Wednesday, &amp;c. This charter, to give it a more
    sacred sanction, he offered on the altar of St.&nbsp;Peter at Rome
    in the pilgrimage which he made to that city in 855.<a
    id="c15_3d"> </a>He likewise procured it to be confirmed by the
    pope.<a
      href="#fn_173"
      class="anchor">173</a>
    <a id="c15_3e"> </a>He carried with him to Rome his youngest and
    best beloved son Alfred, rebuilt there the school for the English,
    and ordered to be sent every year to Rome one hundred mancuses<a
      href="#fn_174"
      class="anchor">174</a>
    for the pope, one hundred for the church of St.&nbsp;Peter, and as
    much for that of St.&nbsp;Paul, to furnish them with lights on
    Easter Eve. He extended the Romescot or Peter-pence to his whole
    kingdom. He reigned two years after his return from Rome, and died
    in 857. He ordained, that throughout all his own hereditary lands,
    every ten families shall maintain one poor person with meat,
    drink, and apparel; from whence came the Corrodies which still
    remain in divers places. St.&nbsp;Swithin departed to eternal
    bliss, which he had always thirsted after, on the 2d of July, 862,
    in the reign of king Ethelbert. His body was buried, according to
    his order, in the church-yard, where his grave might be trodden on
    by passengers.</p>
  <p>
    About one hundred years after, in the days of king Edgar, his
    relics were taken up by St.&nbsp;Ethelwold, then bishop of
    Winchester, and translated into the church in 964. On which
    occasion Malmesbury affirms that such a number of miraculous cures
    of all kinds were wrought, as was never to the memory of man known
    to have been in any other place.<a id="c15_3f"> </a>Lanfrid, in
    the original Saxon Lantfred, called by Leland all illustrious
    doctor, being then a monk at Winchester, wrote, in 980, a history
    of this translation, and of the miraculous cures of a blind man,
    and many others through the intercession of this saint; which
    history has never been printed; though we have two beautiful fair
    manuscript copies of it, the one in the Cotton, the other in the
    king’s library in the enclosure of Westminster Abbey.<a
      href="#fn_175"
      class="anchor">175</a>
    In the reign of William the Conqueror, Walkelyn, bishop of
    Winchester, a Norman, and the king’s relation, laid the foundation
    of the new church in 1079, which he lived to finish with the
    abbey, so that in 1093, the monks, in the presence of almost all
    the bishops and abbots of England, came in great joy from the old
    to the new monastery, and on the feast of St.&nbsp;Swithin, the
    shrine of this saint was in another solemn procession translated
    from the old to the new church; and on the next day the bishop’s
    men began to demolish the old abbey. William of Wickham, the
    celebrated chancellor of England in the reign of Edward&nbsp;III.
    and founder of a great college in Oxford, in 1379, added the nave
    and west front to this cathedral which is now standing.<a

    Trinity under the patronage of St.&nbsp;Peter; afterward by

    St.&nbsp;Swithin is commemorated in the Roman Martyrology on the
    2d of July, which was the day of his death; but his chief festival
    in England was on the 15th of the same month, the day of the
    translation of his relics. See the calendar prefixed to the
    chronicle entitled Scala Mundi in a fair MS. in folio in the
    library of the English college at Douay; also the Sarum Breviary
    and Missal. An arm of St.&nbsp;Swithin was kept in the abbey of
    Peterborough, as is mentioned by Hugh Candidus or White, in his
    accurate history of that monastery, published by Mr.&nbsp;Spark,
    p.&nbsp;1723. The abbey of Hyde was first built within the
    precincts of the cathedral by king Edward the Elder, in pursuance
    of his father Alfred’s will, for secular canons, over whom
    St.&nbsp;Grimbald was intended to preside, had not his death
    prevented it. These canons, after sixty years’ continuance,
    yielded this church to the monks whom, in 964, St.&nbsp;Ethelwold
    brought in; from which time this abbey was called Newminster till
    it was translated by king Henry&nbsp;I. and the bishop William
    Giffard, to a place near the walls of the city called Hyde. Of
    this magnificent abbey not so much as the walls are left standing,
    though in it lay the remains of king Edward, his son Alfred, his
    daughter St.&nbsp;Eadburga, &amp;c. Its church was dedicated to
    the Holy Trinity, St.&nbsp;Peter, and St.&nbsp;Grimbald. See the
    short life of St.&nbsp;Swithin, written by Wolstan, a monk of
    Winchester, dedicated to St.&nbsp;Elphege, then bishop of that
    city, in 1001, but translated to Canterbury in 1006. It is

    ST.&nbsp;EUSTATHIUS, CONFESSOR.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    From St.&nbsp;Athanasius, Sozomen, Theodoret, l.&nbsp;1, Hist.

  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 338.</p>
  <p id="c16_1a">
    St.&nbsp;Eustathius was a native of Sida in Pamphylia, and with
    heroic constancy confessed the faith of Christ before the pagan
    persecutors, as St.&nbsp;Athanasius assures us,<a
      href="#fn_178"
      class="anchor">178</a>
    though it does not appear whether this happened under Dioclesian
    or Licinius. He was learned, eloquent, and eminently endowed with
    all virtue, especially an ardent zeal for the purity of our holy
    faith. Being made bishop of Beræa in Syria he began in that
    obscure see to be highly considered in the Church, insomuch that
    St.&nbsp;Alexander of Alexandria wrote to him in particular
    against Arius and his impious writings, in 323.
    St.&nbsp;Philogonius, bishop of Antioch, a prelate illustrious for
    his confession of the faith, in the persecution of Licinius, died
    in 323. One Paulinus succeeded him, but seems a man not equal to
    the functions of that high station; for, during the short time he
    governed that church, tares began to grow up among the good seed.
    To root these out, when that dignity became again vacant, in 324,
    the zeal and abilities of St.&nbsp;Eustathius were called for, and
    he was accordingly translated to this see, in dignity the next to
    Alexandria, and the third in the world. He vigorously opposed the
    motion, but was compelled to acquiesce. Indeed, translations of
    bishops, if made without cogent reasons of necessity, become, to
    many, dangerous temptations of ambition and avarice, and open a
    door to those fatal vices into the sanctuary.<a id="c16_1b">
    </a>To put a bar to this evil, St.&nbsp;Eustathius, in the same
    year, assisting at the general council of Nice, zealously
    concurred with his fellow bishops to forbid for the time to come
    all removals of bishops from one see to another.<a
      href="#fn_179"
      class="anchor">179</a>
    The new patriarch distinguished himself in that venerable assembly
    by his zeal against Arianism. Soon after his return to Antioch he
    held a council there to unite his church, which he found divided
    by factions. He was very strict and severe in examining into the
    characters of those whom he admitted into the clergy, and he
    constantly rejected all those whose principles, faith, or manners
    appeared suspected: among whom were several who became afterward
    ringleaders of Arianism. Amidst his external employs for the
    service of others, he did not forget that charity must always
    begin at home, and he labored in the first place to sanctify his
    own soul; but after watering his own garden he did not confine the
    stream there, but let it flow abroad to enrich the neighboring
    soil, and to dispense plenty and fruitfulness all around. He sent
    into other diocesses that were subject to his patriarchate, men
    capable of instructing and encouraging the faithful.<a
    id="c16_1c"> </a>Eusebius, archbishop of Cæsarea, in Palestine
    (which church was, in some measure, subject to Antioch), favored
    the new heresy in such a manner as to alarm the zeal of our
    saint.<a
      href="#fn_180"
      class="anchor">180</a>
    This raised a violent storm against him.</p>
  <p>
    Eusebius of Nicomedia laid a deep plot with his Arian friends to
    remove St.&nbsp;Eustathius from Antioch, who had attacked Eusebius
    of Cæsarea, and accused him of altering the Nicene Creed.
    Hereupon, Eusebius of Nicomedia, pretending a great desire to see
    the city of Jerusalem, set out in great state, taking with him his
    confidant, Theognis of Nice. At Jerusalem they met Eusebius of
    Cæsarea, Patrophilus of Scythopolis, Aëtius of Lydda, Theodotus of
    Laodicea, and several others, all of the Arian faction; who
    returned with them to Antioch. There they assembled together, as
    in a Synod, in 331, and a debauched woman, whom the Arians had
    suborned, coming in, showed a child which she suckled at her
    breast, and declared that she had it by Eustathius. The saint
    protested his innocence, and alleged that the apostle forbids a
    priest to be condemned unless convicted by two or more
    witnesses.<a id="c16_1d"> </a>This woman, before her death, after
    a long illness, called in a great number of the clergy, and
    publicly declared to them the innocence of the holy bishop, and
    confessed that the Arians had given her money for this action,
    pretending that no perjury was implied in her oath, upon the
    frivolous and foolish plea that she had the child by a brazier of
    the city called Eustathius.<a
      href="#fn_181"
      class="anchor">181</a>
    The Arians accused him also of Sabellianism, as Socrates and
    others testify; this being their general charge and slander
    against all who professed the orthodox faith.</p>
  <p>
    The Catholic bishops who were present with Eustathius, cried out
    loudly against the injustice of these proceedings, but could not
    be heard, and the Arians pronounced a sentence of deposition
    against the saint; and Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis hastened
    to inform the emperor Constantine of these proceedings.<a
    id="c16_1e"> </a>The Arian bishops invited Eusebius of Cæsarea to
    exchange his see for the patriarchal chair of Antioch, but he
    alleged the prohibition of the canons; and the emperor Constantine
    commended his modesty by a letter which Eusebius has inserted in
    his life of that prince.<a
      href="#fn_182"
      class="anchor">182</a>
    <a id="c16_1f"> </a>We should have been more edified with his
    humility had this circumstance been only recorded by others.<a
      href="#fn_183"
      class="anchor">183</a>
    <a id="c16_1g"> </a>This happened, not in 340, as Baronius and
    Petavius imagine, but in 330 or 331, as is manifest not only from
    the testimony of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Philostorgius,
    but also from several circumstances of the affair.<a
      href="#fn_184"
      class="anchor">184</a>
    The people of Antioch raised a great sedition on this occasion,
    but the emperor Constantine, being prepossessed by the slanders of
    the two bishops, ordered St.&nbsp;Eustathius to repair to
    Constantinople, and thence sent him into banishment. The holy
    pastor assembled the people before his departure from Antioch, and
    exhorted them to remain steadfast in the true doctrine: which
    exhortations were of great weight in preserving many in the
    Catholic faith. St.&nbsp;Eustathius was banished with several
    priests and deacons first into Thrace, as St.&nbsp;Jerome and
    St.&nbsp;Chrysostom testify, and from thence into Illyricum, as
    Theodoret adds. Socrates and Sozomen confound him with a priest of
    Constantinople of the same name, when they tell us he was recalled
    by Jovian, and survived till the year 370: for St.&nbsp;Eustathius
    died thirty years before St.&nbsp;Meletius was advanced to the see
    of Antioch in 360, as Theodoret testifies. Nor was he mentioned in
    the council of Sardica, or in any of the disputes that followed;
    and our best critics and historians conclude him to have been dead
    in 337.<a id="c16_1h"> </a>Philippi, in Macedon, which, in the
    division of the empire into diocesses, was comprised in that of
    Illyricum, was the place of his death,<a
      href="#fn_185"
      class="anchor">185</a>
    but his body was interred at Trajanopolis, in Thrace, from which
    city Calandion, one of his successors, caused it to be translated
    to Antioch, about the year 482, as Theodorus Lector informs us.<a
      href="#fn_186"
      class="anchor">186</a></p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Eustathius bore his exile with patience and perfect
    submission, and was under its disgraces and hardships greater and
    more glorious than whilst his zeal and other virtues shone with
    the brightest lustre on the patriarchal throne. We may please
    ourselves in those actions in which we seem to be something; into
    which, however, self-love, under a thousand forms, easily
    insinuates itself. But the maxims of our Divine Redeemer teach us
    that no circumstances are so happy for the exercise of the most
    heroic virtue as humiliations and distresses when sent by
    Providence. These put our love to the test, apply the remedy to
    the very root of our spiritual disorders, employ the most perfect
    virtues of meekness, forgiveness, and patience, and call forth our
    resignation, humility, and reliance on Providence; in these trials
    we learn most perfectly to die to our passions, to know ourselves,
    to feel our own nothingness and miseries, and with St. Paul to
    take pleasure in our infirmities. Here all virtue is more pure and
    perfect. A&nbsp;Christian suffering with patience and joy, bears
    in spirit the nearest resemblance to his crucified Master, and
    enters deepest into his most perfect sentiments of humility,
    meekness, and love; for Jesus on his cross is the model by which
    his disciples are bound to form themselves, which they nowhere can
    do with greater advantage than when they are in a like state of
    desolation and suffering.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;ELIER OR HELIER, HERMIT,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    In the isle of Jersey and on the coasts of Normandy the name of
    this servant of God has been in singular veneration from the time
    of his happy death. He was converted to the faith by
    St.&nbsp;Marcou, a holy abbot in Armorica, and being inflamed with
    an ardent desire of serving God in the practice of perfect virtue;
    retired into the isle of Jersey, and choosing for his abode a cave
    on the summit of a rock of difficult access, there led an
    eremitical life in rigorous fasting and assiduous prayer. In this
    lonely retreat he was murdered by robbers or infidel barbarians.
    The chief town in the island, which is situate seven leagues from
    Cotentin, bears his name. The dean of the island is still invited
    to all diocesan synods of Coutances, the island having been

  <p class="subhead">
    IN THE FIFTH CENTURY.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Alexius or Alexis is a perfect model of the most generous
    contempt of the world. He was the only son of a rich senator of
    Rome, born and educated in that capital, in the fifth century.
    From the charitable example of his pious parents he learned, from
    his tender years, that the riches which are given away to the
    poor, remain with us for ever; and that alms-deeds are a treasure
    transferred to heaven, with the interest of an immense reward. And
    whilst yet a child, not content to give all he could, he left
    nothing unattempted to compass or solicit the relief of all whom
    he saw in distress. But the manner in which he dealt about his
    liberal alms was still a greater proof of the noble sentiments of
    virtue with which his soul was fired; for by this he showed that
    he thought himself most obliged to those who received his charity,
    and regarded them as his greatest benefactors. The more he
    enlarged his views of eternity, and raised his thoughts and
    desires to the bright scene of immortal bliss, the more did he
    daily despise all earthly toys; for, when once the soul is thus
    upon the wing, and soars upwards, how does the glory of this world
    lessen in her eye! and how does she contemn the empty pageantry of
    all that worldlings call great!</p>
  <p>
    Fearing lest the fascination, or at least the distraction of
    temporal honors might at length divide or draw his heart too much
    from those only noble and great objects, he entertained thoughts
    of renouncing the advantages of his birth, and retiring from the
    more dangerous part of the world. Having, in compliance with the
    will of his parents, married a rich and virtuous lady, he on the
    very day of the nuptials, making use of the liberty which the laws
    of God and his Church give a person before the marriage be
    consummated, of preferring a more perfect state, secretly
    withdrew, in order to break all the ties which held him in the
    world. In disguise he travelled into a distant country, embraced
    extreme poverty, and resided in a hut adjoining to a church
    dedicated to the Mother of God. Being, after some time there,
    discovered to be a stranger of distinction, he returned home, and
    being received as a poor pilgrim, lived some time unknown in his
    father’s house, bearing the contumely and ill treatment of the
    servants with invincible patience and silence. A&nbsp;little
    before he died, he by a letter discovered himself to his parents.
    He flourished in the reign of the emperor Honorius, Innocent the
    first being bishop of Rome; and is honored in the calendars of the
    Latins, Greeks, Syrians, Maronites, and Armenians. His interment
    was celebrated with the greatest pomp by the whole city of Rome,
    on the Aventin hill. His body was found there in 1216, in the
    ancient church of St.&nbsp;Boniface, whilst Honorius&nbsp;III. sat
    in St.&nbsp;Peter’s chair, and at this day is the most precious
    treasure of a sumptuous church on the same spot, which bears his
    name jointly with that of St.&nbsp;Boniface, gives title to a
    cardinal, and is in the hands of the Hieronymites.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    The extraordinary paths in which the Holy Ghost is pleased
    sometimes to conduct certain privileged souls are rather to be
    admired than imitated. If it cost them so much to seek
    humiliations, how diligently ought we to make a good use of those
    at least which providence sends us! It is only by humbling
    ourselves on all occasions that we can walk in the path of true
    humility, and root out of our hearts all secret pride. The poison
    of this vice infects all states and conditions: it often lurks
    undiscovered in the foldings of the heart even after a man has got
    the mastery over all his other passions. Pride always remains even
    for the most perfect principally to fight against; and unless we
    watch continually against it, nothing will remain sound or
    untainted in our lives; this vice will creep even into our best
    actions, infect the whole circle of our lives, and become a main
    spring of all the motions of our heart; and what is the height of
    our misfortune, the deeper its wounds are, the more is the soul
    stupified by its venom, and the less capable is she of feeling her
    most grievous disease and spiritual death.<a id="c17_1a">

    SAINTS SPERATUS AND HIS&nbsp;COMPANIONS.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    COMMONLY CALLED THE SCILLITAN MARTYRS.</p>
  <p>
    When the emperor Severus returned victorious from having
    vanquished the kings who had taken part with Nigar against him, he
    published his cruel edicts against the Christians in the year of
    Christ 202, the tenth of his reign. But the general laws of the
    empire against foreign religions, and the former edicts of several
    emperors against the Christians, were a sufficient warrant to many
    governors to draw the sword against them before that time; and we
    find that the persecution was very hot in Africa two years before,
    under the proconsul Saturninus, in the eighth year of Severus and
    two hundredth of Christ. The first who suffered at Carthage were
    twelve persons, commonly called the Scillitan Martyrs, probably
    because they were of Scillita, a town of the proconsular Africa.
    They were brought prisoners to Carthage, and on the 16th of July
    were presented to the proconsul whilst he was seated on his
    tribunal. The six principal among them were Speratus, Narzalis,
    and Cittinus; and three women, Donata, Secunda, and Vestina. The
    proconsul offered them the emperor’s pardon if they would worship
    the gods of the Romans. Speratus answered in the name of all: “We
    have never committed any crime, we have injured no one; so far
    from it, we have always thanked God for the evil treatment we have
    received; wherefore we declare to you that we worship no other God
    but the true one, who is the lord and master of all things; we
    pray for those who persecute us unjustly, according to the law we
    have received.” The proconsul urged them to swear by the emperor’s
    genius. Speratus said, “I&nbsp;know not the genius of the emperor
    of this world, but I&nbsp;serve the God of heaven, whom no mortal
    man hath ever seen or can see. I&nbsp;never committed any crime
    punishable by the laws of the state. I&nbsp;pay the public duties
    for whatever I&nbsp;buy, acknowledging the emperor for my temporal
    lord; but I&nbsp;adore none but my God, who is the King of kings,
    and sovereign Lord over all the nations in the world. I&nbsp;have
    been guilty of no crime, and therefore cannot have incurred
    punishment.” Hereupon the proconsul said, “Let them be carried to
    prison, and put in the wooden stocks till to-morrow.”</p>
  <p>
    On the day following, the proconsul being seated on his tribunal,
    ordered them all to be brought before him, and said to the women,
    “Honor our prince, and offer sacrifice to the gods.” Donata
    replied, “We give to Cæsar the honor that is due to Cæsar; but we
    adore and offer sacrifice to God alone.” Vestina said,
    “I&nbsp;also am a Christian.” Secunda said, “I&nbsp;also believe
    in my God, and will continue faithful to him. As for your gods we
    will neither serve nor adore them.” The proconsul then ordered
    them into custody, and having called up the men, he said to
    Speratus, “Art thou still resolved to remain a Christian?”
    Speratus replied, “Yes, I&nbsp;am, be it known to all, I&nbsp;am a
    Christian.” All that had been apprehended with him cried out, “We
    also are Christians.” The proconsul said, “Will you not then so
    much as deliberate upon the matter, or have any favor shown you?”
    Speratus replied, “Do what you please; we die with joy for the
    sake of Jesus Christ.” The proconsul asked, “What books are those
    which you read and have in reverence?”<a id="c17_2a"> </a>Speratus
    answered, “The four gospels of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;
    the epistles of the apostle St.&nbsp;Paul, and the rest of the
    scriptures, revealed by God.”<a
      href="#fn_188"
      class="anchor">188</a>
    The proconsul said, “I&nbsp;give you three days to repent in.”
    Upon which Speratus made answer, “We will never depart from the
    faith of our Saviour Jesus Christ, therefore take what course you
    think fit.” The proconsul seeing their constancy and resolution,
    pronounced sentence against them in these terms: “Speratus,
    Narzalis, Cittinus, Veturius, Felix, Acyllinus, Lætantius,
    Januaria, Generosa, Vestina, Donata, and Secunda, having
    acknowledged themselves Christians, and having refused to pay due
    honor and respect to the emperor, I&nbsp;condemn them to be
    beheaded.” This sentence being read, Speratus, and all those who
    were with him, said, “We give God thanks for vouchsafing to
    receive us this day as martyrs in heaven, for confessing his
    name.” Having said this, they were led to the place of execution,
    where they all fell on their knees, and once more gave thanks to
    Jesus Christ. Whilst they continued in prayer, their heads were
    struck off.<a id="c17_2b"> </a>The faithful who transcribed their

    that Saturninus, who first drew the sword against the Christians

    after carrying on the persecution ten years, whilst he was making
    war in Britain, being on his march with his army, his eldest son
    Bassianus, surnamed Antonius Caracalla, who marched after him,
    stopped his horse, and drew his sword to stab him, but was
    prevented by others. Severus only reproached him for it, but died
    soon after at York, of grief for his son’s treachery, rather than
    of the gout, on the 4th of February in the year 211, having lived
    sixty-five years, and reigned seventeen and eight months. His two
    sons, Antoninus Caracalla and Geta, succeeded him; but the elder
    caused the latter to be stabbed in his mother’s bosom, who was
    sprinkled with his blood. See the acts of the Scillitan martyrs,

    ST.&nbsp;MARCELLINA,&nbsp;V.</h3>
  <p>
    She was the eldest sister to St.&nbsp;Ambrose and Satyrus, and
    after the death of her father, who was prefect of the Gauls,
    removed to Rome with her pious mother and brothers. She was
    discreet beyond her years, and from her cradle sought with her
    whole heart the only thing for which she was created and sent into
    the world. Being charged at Rome with the education of her two
    brothers, she inspired them, by words and example, with an ardent
    thirst of virtue. She taught them that nobleness of blood cannot
    enhance merit, nor make men more illustrious unless they despise
    it; and that learning is an unpardonable crime and folly, if by it
    a man should desire to know everything that is in heaven and earth
    but himself; for with the true knowledge of ourselves are all our
    studies to begin and end, if we desire to render them in any
    degree advantageous to ourselves. She kindled in their tender
    breasts a vehement desire, not of the show of virtue, but to
    become truly virtuous. In her whole conduct all her view was only
    the glory of God. The better to pursue this great end she resolved
    to renounce the world; and on Christmas-day, in 352, she put on
    the religious habit, and received the veil from the hands of pope
    Liberius, in St.&nbsp;Peter’s church, in presence of an incredible
    multitude of people. The pope, in a short discourse on that
    occasion, exhorted her frequently to love only our Lord Jesus
    Christ, the chaste spouse of her soul, to live in continual
    abstinence, mortification, silence, and prayer, and always to
    behave herself in the church with the utmost respect and awe. He
    mentioned to her the page of Alexander the Great, who, for fear of
    disturbing the solemnity of a heathenish sacrifice by shaking off
    his hand a piece of melted wax that was fallen upon it, let it
    burn him to the bone.</p>
  <p>
    Marcellina in her practice went beyond the most perfect lessons.
    She fasted every day till evening; and sometimes passed whole days
    without eating. She never touched any fare but what was of the
    coarsest kinds, and drank only water. She never laid herself down
    to rest till quite overcome with sleep. The greatest part both of
    the day and night she devoted to prayer, pious reading, and tears
    of divine love and compunction. St.&nbsp;Ambrose advised her in
    the decline of her life to moderate her austerities, but always to
    redouble her fervor in tears and holy prayer, especially in
    reciting often the psalms, the Lord’s prayer, and likewise the
    creed, which he calls the seal of a Christian, and the guard of
    our hearts. She continued at Rome after the death of her mother,
    living not in a nunnery but in a private house with one fervent
    virgin, the faithful companion of all her holy exercises.
    St.&nbsp;Ambrose died in 397. She survived him, though it is
    uncertain how long. Her name is mentioned in the Roman and other
    Martyrologies on the 17th of July. See St.&nbsp;Ambrose,

    SAINT ENNODIUS, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;PAVIA,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    Magnus Felix Ennodius was descended of an illustrious family,
    settled in Gaul, and was a kinsman to the greatest lords of his
    time; as, to Faustus, Boëtius, Avienus, Olybrius, &amp;c. He seems
    to call Arles the place of his birth;<a
      href="#fn_192"
      class="anchor">192</a>
    but he passed his first years in Italy, and had his education at
    Milan under the care of an aunt, after whose death he took to wife
    a rich and noble lady. Eloquence and poetry were the favorite
    studies of his youth, and he had the misfortune to be drawn astray
    into the wide path of the world. But he was struck with remorse,
    and listening to the voice of divine grace, changed his life and
    wept bitterly for his past disorders. Out of gratitude to the
    divine mercy for his call, he entered into orders with the consent
    of his wife, who at the same time devoted herself to God in a
    state of perpetual continency.<a id="c17_4a"> </a>Having a
    particular confidence in the powerful intercession of
    St.&nbsp;Victor, the martyr at Milan, he earnestly implored
    through it the grace to lead a holy life as he informs us.<a
      href="#fn_193"
      class="anchor">193</a></p>
  <p>
    Being ordained deacon, yet young, by St.&nbsp;Epiphanius of Pavia,
    he from that time despised profane studies, to give himself up
    entirely to those that are sacred. He wrote an apology for pope
    Symmachus and his council against the schism formed in favor of
    Laurence. He was pitched upon to make a panegyric upon Theodoric,
    king of Italy, whom he commends only for his victories and
    temporal success. He wrote the life of St.&nbsp;Epiphanius of
    Pavia, who died in 497, and was succeeded by Maximus; likewise
    that of St.&nbsp;Antony of Lerins, who is mentioned in the Roman
    Martyrology on the 26th of December, besides several letters and
    other works, both in prose and verse.<a id="c17_4b"> </a>He
    assures us, that under a violent fever, in which he was given over
    by the physicians, he had recourse to the heavenly physician
    through the intercession of his patron St.&nbsp;Victor, and that
    in a moment he found himself restored to perfect health.<a
      href="#fn_194"
      class="anchor">194</a>
    To perpetuate his gratitude for this benefit, he wrote a work
    which he called Eucharisticon, or Thanksgiving; in which he gives
    a short account of his life, especially of his conversion from the
    world, and how, through the intercession of St.&nbsp;Victor, he
    obtained the grace for his wife that she freely entered into his
    views in their making, by joint consent, mutual vows of perpetual
    continency. After the death of Maximus he was advanced to the
    episcopal see of Pavia about the year 510, not in 490, as Labbe
    mistakes; for, in his Eucharisticon, he says he was only sixteen
    years old when Theodoric came into Italy in 489. He governed his
    church with a zeal and authority worthy a true disciple of
    St.&nbsp;Epiphanius.</p>
  <p>
    Ennodius was made choice of by pope Hormisdas to endeavor the
    reunion of the Eastern to the Western Church. The emperor
    Anastasius fomented the division by favoring the Eutychian heresy,
    by banishing many orthodox prelates, and by protecting
    schismatical bishops of Constantinople; and in dissembling (the
    basest character of a prince) he was a second Herod or Tiberius,
    whose artifices could not leave them even in things where their
    interest was not concerned. Upon this errand Ennodius made two
    journeys to Constantinople, the first in the year 515, with
    Fortunatus, bishop of Catana, and the second in 517, with
    Peregrinus, bishop of Misenum. The points upon which he was
    ordered to insist were, that the faith of the council of Chalcedon
    and the letters of pope Leo against Nestorius, Eutyches,
    Dioscorus, and their followers, Timothy Elurus and Peter the
    Fuller, should be received; the anathema, pronounced against
    Acacius of Constantinople and Peter of Antioch, subscribed; and
    that the emperor should recall the bishops whom he had banished
    for adhering to the orthodox faith and communion. The emperor,
    whose conduct in all he did was equivocal, sent back the legates
    with a letter, wherein he declared that he condemned Nestorius and
    Eutyches, and received the council of Chalcedon. Other things he
    promised to conclude by ambassadors whom he would send to Rome;
    but his only aim was to gain time, and even whilst Ennodius was at
    Constantinople he condemned to banishment four bishops of
    Illyricum for the Catholic cause, namely, Laurence of Lignida,
    Alcyson of Nicopolis, Gaianus of Naïssum, and Evangelus of
    Paulitala. He deferred sending his ambassadors till the middle of
    the next year, and then, instead of bishops as he had promised,
    sent only two laymen, Theopompus, Comes Domesticorum or captain of
    his guards, and Severianus, Comes Consistorii or counsellor of
    state, and their instructions were confined to general
    protestations of laboring for the peace of the Church. The pope
    answered that, far from having any need of being entreated on that
    head, he threw himself at the emperor’s feet to implore his
    protection for the peace and welfare of God’s Church.</p>
  <p>
    Ennodius’s second legation into the East proved as unsuccessful as
    the former; for Anastasius rejected the formulary which the pope
    had drawn up for the union, and endeavored to bribe the legates
    with money.<a id="c17_4c"> </a>But finding them proof against all
    temptations, he caused them to be sent out of his palace through a
    back door, and put on board a ship with two prefects and several
    Magisterians,<a
      href="#fn_195"
      class="anchor">195</a>
    who had orders not to suffer them to enter into any city.
    Notwithstanding this, the legates found an opportunity of
    dispersing their protestations in all cities; but the bishops who
    received them, from the dread they were under of being accused,
    sent them all to Constantinople. Upon this, Anastasius being very
    much exasperated, dismissed about two hundred bishops who were
    already come to a council which was to have been held at Heraclea
    to compose the distracted state of the Oriental church. Such was
    the conclusion of the promise this emperor had given of concurring
    to restore union between the churches. The people and the senate
    reproached him with the breach of the oath he had made to that
    purpose; but he impiously said that there was a law which
    commanded an emperor to forswear himself and to tell a lie in
    cases of necessity. This confirmed the people in their general
    suspicion, that he had imbibed the opinions of the Manichees.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ennodius was obliged to put to sea in an old rotten
    vessel, and all persons were forbidden to suffer him to land in
    any port of the eastern empire, whereby he was exposed to manifest
    danger. Nevertheless, he arrived safe in Italy and returned to
    Pavia. The glory of suffering for the faith, which his zeal and
    constancy had procured him, far from serving to make him slothful
    or remiss in the discharge of his pastoral duties, was on the
    contrary a spur to him in the more earnest pursuit of virtue, lest
    by sluggishness he should deprive himself of the advantages which
    he might seem to have begun to attain. He exerted his zeal in the
    conversion of souls, his liberality in relieving the poor, and in
    building and adorning churches, and his piety and devotion in
    composing sacred poems on the Blessed Virgin, St.&nbsp;Cyprian,
    St.&nbsp;Stephen, St.&nbsp;Dionysius of Milan, St.&nbsp;Ambrose,
    St.&nbsp;Euphemia, St.&nbsp;Nazarius, St.&nbsp;Martin, &amp;c., on
    the mysteries of Pentecost and on the Ascension, on a baptistery
    adorned with the pictures of several martyrs whose relics were
    deposited in it.<a id="c17_4d"> </a>He wrote two new forms of
    blessing the paschal candle, in which the divine protection on the
    faithful is implored against winds, storms, and all dangers
    through the malice of our invisible enemies.<a
      href="#fn_196"
      class="anchor">196</a>
    St.&nbsp;Ennodius died on the 1st of August, 521, being only
    forty-eight years old. He is styled a great and glorious confessor
    by the popes Nicholas&nbsp;I. and John&nbsp;VIII., and is honored
    in the Roman Martyrology on the 17th of July. His works were
    published by two Jesuits, F.&nbsp;Andrew Scot at Tournay in 1610,
    and by F.&nbsp;James Sirmond, with notes, at Paris, in 1611, and
    most completely among the works of F. Sirmond, at Paris in 1696,

    ST.&nbsp;LEO&nbsp;IV. POPE,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was son of a Roman nobleman, had been educated in the monastery
    of St.&nbsp;Martin without the walls, and was made by
    Sergius&nbsp;II. priest of the four crowned martyrs. He was chosen
    pope after the death of Sergius&nbsp;II. in 847, and governed the
    Church eight years, three months, and some days. The Saracens from
    Calabria had lately plundered St.&nbsp;Peter’s church on the
    Vatican, and were still hovering about Rome. Leo made it his first
    care to repair the ornamental part of this church, especially the
    Confession or burying-place of St.&nbsp;Peter with the altar which
    stood upon it. To prevent a second plundering of that holy place,
    he, with the approbation and liberal contributions of the emperor
    Lothaire, enclosed it and the whole Vatican hill with a wall, and
    built there a new <i>rione</i> or quarter of the city, which from
    him is called Leonina. He rebuilt or repaired the walls of the
    city, fortified with fifteen towers. Whilst he was putting Rome in
    a posture of defence, the Saracens marched towards Porto in order
    to plunder that town. The Neapolitans sent an army to the
    assistance of the Romans: the pope met these troops at Ostia, gave
    them his blessing, and all the soldiers received the holy
    communion at his hands. After the pope’s departure, a bloody
    battle ensued, and the Saracens were all slain, taken, or
    dispersed. The good pope considered the sins of the people as the
    chief source of public disasters; and being inflamed with a holy
    zeal, he most vigorously exerted his authority for the reformation
    of manners and of the discipline of the Church. For this purpose
    he held at Rome a council of sixty-seven bishops; and, among other
    instances, he deposed and excommunicated Anastasius, cardinal
    priest of St.&nbsp;Marcellus’s church, because he had neglected to
    reside in his parish. He received honorably Ethelwolph, king of
    England, who, in 854, made a pilgrimage to Rome.</p>
  <p>
    Pope Leo directed to all bishops and pastors a Homily on the
    Pastoral Care, published by Labbe from the Vatican manuscripts,
    and also extant in the Roman Pontifical. In it all the chief
    functions of the pastoral charge are regulated, and every duty
    enforced with no less learning than piety. Among other miracles
    performed by this holy pope, it is recorded that by the sign of
    the cross he extinguished a great fire in the city, which
    threatened the church of the prince of the apostles.<a
    id="c17_5a"> </a>He died on the 17th of July, 855, and
    Bennet&nbsp;III., priest of the church of St.&nbsp;Calixtus, was
    immediately chosen pope in his room.<a
      href="#fn_197"
      class="anchor">197</a>
    He, with many tears, begged that so formidable a burden might not
    be laid on his shoulders, but could not prevail. Anastasius, the
    deposed priest, set up for pope, and procured the protection of
    the emperor Louis&nbsp;II.; but the steady unanimity of the people
    in the election of Bennet&nbsp;III., overcame this opposition,<a
    id="c17_5b"> </a>and he was consecrated on the 1st day of
    September in the same year, 855, as is related by Anastasius, who
    was then living, and shortly after (before the year&nbsp;870)
    Bibliothecarian of the church of Rome, the most learned man and
    the most shining ornament of that age, as Dr.&nbsp;Cave allows

    year of Adrian’s reign, whence Sulpicius Severus places the fourth
    general persecution under this emperor.<a id="c18_1a">
    </a>However, he put a stop to it about the year&nbsp;124, moved
    probably both by the apologies of Quadratus and Aristides, and by
    a letter which Serenius Granianus, proconsul of Asia, had written
    to him in favor of the Christians.<a
      href="#fn_198"
      class="anchor">198</a>
    Nay, he had Christ in veneration, not as the Saviour of the world,
    but as a wonder or novelty, and kept his image together with that
    of Apollonius Tyanæus. This God was pleased to permit, that his
    afflicted church might enjoy some respite. It was, however, again
    involved in the disgrace which the Jews (with whom the Pagans at
    these times in some degree confounded the Christians) drew upon
    themselves by their rebellion, which gave occasion to the last
    entire destruction of Jerusalem in&nbsp;134.<a id="c18_1b">
    </a>Then, as St.&nbsp;Paulinus informs us,<a
      href="#fn_199"
      class="anchor">199</a>
    Adrian caused a statue of Jupiter to be erected on the place where
    Christ rose from the dead, and a marble Venus on the place of his
    crucifixion; and at Bethlehem,<a
      href="#fn_200"
      class="anchor">200</a>
    a grotto consecrated in honor of Adonis or Thammuz, to whom he
    also dedicated the cave where Christ was born. This prince,
    towards the end of his reign, abandoned himself more than ever to
    acts of cruelty, and being awaked by a fit of superstition, he
    again drew his sword against the innocent flock of Christ. He
    built a magnificent country palace at Tibur, now Tivoli, sixteen
    miles from Rome, upon the most agreeable banks of the river Anio,
    now called Teverone. Here he placed whatever could be procured
    most curious out of all the provinces. Having finished the
    building, he intended to dedicate it by heathenish ceremonies,
    which he began by offering sacrifices, in order to induce the
    idols to deliver their oracles. The demons answered: “The widow
    Symphorosa and her seven sons daily torment us by invoking their
    God; if they sacrifice, we promise to be favorable to your
    vows.”</p>
  <p>
    This lady lived with her seven sons upon a plentiful estate which
    they enjoyed at Tivoli, and she liberally expended her treasures
    in assisting the poor, especially in relieving the Christians that
    suffered for the faith. She was widow of St.&nbsp;Getulius or
    Zoticus, who had been crowned with martyrdom with his brother
    Amantius. They were both tribunes of legions or colonels in the
    army, and are honored among the martyrs on the 10th of June.
    Symphorosa had buried their bodies in her own farm, and sighing to
    see her sons and herself united with them in immortal bliss, she
    prepared herself to follow them by the most fervent exercise of
    all good works.</p>
  <p>
    Adrian, whose superstition was alarmed at this answer of his gods
    or their priests, ordered her and her sons to be seized, and
    brought before him. She came with joy in her countenance, praying
    all the way for herself and her children, that God would grant
    them the grace to confess his holy name with constancy. The
    emperor exhorted them at first in mild terms to sacrifice.
    Symphorosa answered: “My husband, Getulius, and his brother
    Amantius, being your tribunes, have suffered divers torments for
    the name of Jesus Christ rather than sacrifice to idols; and they
    have vanquished your demons by their death, choosing to be
    beheaded rather than to be overcome. The death they suffered drew
    upon them ignominy among men, but glory among the angels; and they
    now enjoy eternal life in heaven.” The emperor changing his voice,
    said to her in an angry tone: “Either sacrifice to the most
    powerful gods, with thy sons, or thou thyself shalt be offered up
    as a sacrifice together with them.” Symphorosa answered: “Your
    gods cannot receive me as a sacrifice; but if I&nbsp;am burnt for
    the name of Jesus Christ, my death will increase the torment which
    your devils endure in their flames. But can I&nbsp;hope for so
    great a happiness as to be offered with my children a sacrifice to
    the true and living God?” Adrian said: “Either sacrifice to my
    gods, or you shall all miserably perish.” Symphorosa said “Do not
    imagine that fear will make me change; I&nbsp;am desirous to be at
    rest with my husband, whom you put to death for the name of Jesus
    Christ.” The emperor then ordered her to be carried to the temple
    of Hercules, where she was first buffeted on the cheeks, and
    afterward hung up by the hair of her head. When no torments were
    able to shake her invincible soul, the emperor gave orders that
    she should be thrown into the river with a great stone fastened
    about her neck. Her brother Eugenius, who was one of the chief of
    the council of Tibur, took up her body, and buried it on the road
    near that town.</p>
  <p>
    The next day the emperor sent for her seven sons all together, and
    exhorted them to sacrifice and not imitate the obstinacy of their
    mother. He added the severest threats, but finding all to be in
    vain, he ordered seven stakes with engines and pulleys to be
    planted round the temple of Hercules, and the pious youths to be
    bound upon them; their limbs were in this posture tortured and
    stretched in such manner that the bones were disjointed in all
    parts of their bodies. The young noblemen, far from yielding under
    the violence of their tortures, were encouraged by each other’s
    example, and seemed more eager to suffer than the executioners
    were to torment. At length the emperor commanded them to be put to
    death, in the same place where they were, different ways. The
    eldest called Crescens had his throat cut; the second called
    Julian was stabbed in the breast; Nemesius the third was pierced
    with a lance in his heart; Primativius received his wound in the
    belly, Justin in the back, Stacteus on his sides, and Eugenius the
    youngest died by his body being cleft asunder into two parts
    across his breast from the head down wards. The emperor came the
    next day to the temple of Hercules, and gave orders for a deep
    hole to be dug, and all the bodies of these martyrs to be thrown
    into it. The place was called by the heathen priest, <i>The seven
    Biothanati</i>; which word signifieth in Greek and in the style of
    art magic, such as die by a violent death, particularly such as
    were put to the torture.<a id="c18_1c"> </a>After this, a stop was
    put to the persecution for about eighteen months.<a

    St.&nbsp;Symphorosa set not before the eyes of her children the
    advantages of their riches and birth, or of their father’s
    honorable employments and great exploits; but those of his piety
    and the triumph of his martyrdom. She continually entertained them
    on the glory of heaven, and the happiness of treading in the steps
    of our Divine Redeemer, by the practice of humility, patience,
    resignation, and charity, which virtues are best learned in the
    path of humiliations and sufferings. In these a Christian finds
    this solid treasure, and his unalterable peace and joy both in
    life and death. The honors, riches, applause, and pleasures with
    which the worldly sinner is sometimes surrounded, can never
    satiate his desires; often they do not even reach his heart, which
    under this gorgeous show bleeds as it were inwardly, while silent
    grief, like a worm at the core, preys upon his vitals. Death at
    least always draws aside the curtain, and shows them to have been
    no better than mere dreams and shadows which passed in a moment,
    but have left a cruel sting behind them, which fills the mind with
    horror, dread, remorse, and despair, and racks the whole soul with
    confusion, perplexities, and alarms.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;PHILASTRIUS, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;BRESCIA,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    We know nothing of this saint’s country, only that he quitted it
    and the house and inheritance of his ancestors, like Abraham, the
    more perfectly to disengage himself from the ties of the world. He
    lived in perfect continency, and often passed whole nights in
    meditating on the holy scriptures. Being ordained priest he
    travelled through many provinces to oppose the infidels and
    heretics, especially the Arians, whose fury was at that time
    formidable over the whole Church. His zeal and lively faith gave
    him courage to rejoice with the apostles in suffering for the
    truth, and to bear in his body the marks of the stripes which he
    received by a severe scourging which he underwent for Jesus
    Christ. At Milan he vigorously opposed the endeavors of Auxentius,
    the impious Arian wolf, who labored to destroy the flock of Christ
    there; and our saint was its strenuous guardian before St. Ambrose
    was made bishop of that city. He afterward went to Brescia, and
    finding the inhabitants of that place savage and barbarous, almost
    entirely ignorant in spiritual things, yet desirous to learn, he
    took much pains to instruct them, and had the comfort to see his
    labors crowned with incredible success. He rooted out the tares of
    many errors, and cultivated this wild soil with such assiduity
    that it became fruitful in good works. Being chosen the seventh
    bishop of this see, he exerted himself in the discharge of all his
    pastoral functions with such vigor as even to outdo himself; and
    the authority of his high dignity added the greater weight to his
    endeavors. He was not equal in learning to the Ambroses and
    Austins of that age; but what was wanting in that respect was
    abundantly made up by the example of his life, his spirit of
    perfect humility and piety, and his unwearied application to every
    pastoral duty; and he is an instance of what eminent service
    moderate abilities may be capable of in the Church, when they are
    joined with an heroic degree of virtue.</p>
  <p id="c18_2a">
    To caution his flock against the danger of errors in faith, he
    wrote his Catalogue of Heresies, in which he does not take that
    word in its strict sense and according to the theological
    definition; but sometimes puts in the number of heresies certain
    opinions which he rejects only as less probable, and which are
    problematically disputed; as that the witch of Endor evoked the
    very soul of Samuel.<a
      href="#fn_204"
      class="anchor">204</a>
    He everywhere breathes an ardent zeal for the Catholic faith.
    St.&nbsp;Gaudentius extols his profound humility, his meekness,
    and sweetness towards all men, which was such that it seemed
    natural to him to repay injuries only with kindness and favors,
    and he never discovered the least emotions of anger. By his
    charity and patience he gained the hearts of all men. In all he
    did he sought no interest but that of Jesus Christ; and
    sovereignly contemning all earthly things he pursued and valued
    only those that are eternal. Being most mortified and sparing in
    his diet and apparel, he seemed to know no other use of money than
    to employ it in relieving the poor; and he extended his
    liberality, not only to all that were reduced to beggary, but also
    to tradesmen and all others, whom he often generously enabled to
    carry on, or when expedient to enlarge their business. Though he
    communicated himself with surprising charity and goodness to all
    sorts of persons of every age, sex, and condition, he seemed
    always to receive the poor with particular affection. He trained
    up many pious and eminent disciples, among whom are named
    St.&nbsp;Gaudentius, and one Benevolus, who in his life was a true
    imitator of the apostles; and being afterward preferred to an
    honorable post in the emperor Valentinian’s court, chose rather to
    lay it down than to promulgate a rescript of the empress Justina
    in favor of the Arians.<a id="c18_2b"> </a>St.&nbsp;Austin saw

    He died soon after, and before St.&nbsp;Ambrose, his metropolitan,
    who after his death placed St.&nbsp;Gaudentius in the see of
    Brescia. This saint solemnized every year with his people the day
    on which his master St.&nbsp;Philastrius passed to glory, and
    always honored it with a panegyric; but of these discourses only

    ST.&nbsp;ARNOUL, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;METZ,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    Among the illustrious saints who adorned the court of king
    Clotaire the Great, none is more famous than St.&nbsp;Arnoul. He
    was a Frenchman, born of rich and noble parents; and, having been
    educated in learning and piety, was called to the court of king
    Theodebert, in which he held the second place among the great
    officers of state, being next to Gondulph, mayor of the palace.
    Though young, he was equally admired for prudence in the council
    and for valor in the field. By assiduous prayer, fasting, and
    excessive alms-deeds, he joined the virtues of a perfect Christian
    with the duties of a courtier. Having married a noble lady called
    Doda, he had by her two sons, Clodulf and Ansegisus; by the latter
    the Carlovingian race of kings of France descended from
    St.&nbsp;Arnoul. Fearing the danger of entangling his soul in many
    affairs which passed through his hands, he desired to retire to
    the monastery of Lerins; but being crossed in the execution of his
    project, passed to the court of king Clotaire. That great monarch,
    the first year in which he reigned over all France, assented to
    the unanimous request of the clergy and people of Metz, demanding
    Arnoul for their bishop. Our saint did all that could be done to
    change the measures taken, but in vain. He was consecrated bishop
    in&nbsp;614, and his wife Doda took the religious veil at Triers.
    The king obliged Arnoul still to assist at his councils, and to
    fill the first place at his court. The saint always wore a hair
    shirt under his garments; he sometimes passed three days without
    eating, and his usual food was only barley and water. He seemed to
    regard whatever he possessed as the patrimony of the poor, and his
    alms seemed to exceed all bounds. His benevolence took in all the
    objects of charity, but his discretion singled out those more
    particularly whose greater necessities called more pressingly upon
    his bounty.</p>
  <p>
    In 622 Clotaire&nbsp;II. divided his dominions, and making his son
    Dagobert king of Austrasia, appointed St.&nbsp;Arnoul duke of
    Austrasia and chief counsellor and Pepin of Landen mayor of his
    palace. The reign of this prince was virtuous, prosperous, and
    glorious, so long as Arnoul remained at the helm; but the saint
    anxiously desiring to retire from all business, that he might more
    seriously study to secure his own salvation before he should be
    called hence, never ceased to solicit the king for leave to quit
    the court. Dagobert long refused his consent, but at length, out
    of a scruple lest he should oppose the call of heaven, granted it,
    though with the utmost reluctance. St.&nbsp;Arnoul resigned also
    his bishopric, and retired into the deserts of Vosge, near the
    monastery of Remiremont, on the top of a high mountain, where a
    hermitage is at this day standing. Here the saint labored daily
    with fresh fervor to advance in the path of Christian perfection;
    for the greater progress a person has already made in virtue, the
    more does the prospect enlarge upon him, and the more perfectly
    does he see how much is yet wanting in him, and how great a scope
    is left for exerting his endeavors still more. Who will pretend to
    have made equal advances with St.&nbsp;Paul towards perfection?
    yet he was far from ever thinking that he had finished his work,
    or that he might remit anything in his endeavors. On the contrary,
    we find him imitating the alacrity of those who run in a race who
    do not so much consider what ground they have already cleared, as
    how much still remains to call forth their utmost eagerness and
    strength. Nor can there be a more certain sign that a person has
    not yet arrived at the lowest and first degree of virtue, than
    that he should think he does not need to aim higher. In this
    vigorous pursuit St.&nbsp;Arnoul died on the 16th of August
    in&nbsp;640. His remains were brought to Metz, and enrich the
    great abbey which bears his name. The Roman Martyrology mentions
    him on the 18th of July, on which day the translation of his
    relics was performed; the Gallican on the 16th of August. See his
    life, faithfully compiled by his successor, in Mabillon, Act.

    SAINT FREDERIC, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;UTRECHT,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    He was descended of a most illustrious family among the Frisons,
    and according to the author of his life, was great-grandson to
    Radbod, king of that country, before it was conquered by the
    French. He was trained up in piety and sacred literature among the
    clergy of the church of Utrecht. His fasts and other austerities
    were excessive, and his watchings in fervent prayer were not less
    inimitable.<a id="c18_5a"> </a>Being ordained priest, he was
    charged by bishop Ricfrid with the care of instructing the
    catechumens, and that good prelate dying in&nbsp;820, he was
    chosen the eighth bishop of Utrecht from St.&nbsp;Willibrord.<a
      href="#fn_206"
      class="anchor">206</a>
    The holy man, with many tears, before the clergy and people,
    declared, in moving terms, his incapacity and unworthiness, but by
    the authority of the emperor Louis Debonnaire was compelled to
    submit. He therefore repaired to his metropolitan, the archbishop
    of Mentz, and at Aix-la-Chapelle received the investiture by the
    ring and crosier, and was consecrated by the bishops in presence
    of the emperor, who zealously recommended to him the extirpation
    of the remains of idolatry in Friesland. The new bishop was met by
    the clergy and others of his church, and by them honorably
    conducted from the Rhine to Utrecht. He immediately applied
    himself to establish everywhere the best order, and sent zealous
    and virtuous laborers into the northern parts, to root out the
    relics of idolatry which still subsisted there.</p>
  <p>
    Charlemagne, by treating with severity the conquered Frisons and
    Saxons, had alienated their minds from his empire; but upon his
    death in&nbsp;814, Louis his son, whom he had made in his own
    life-time king of Aquitain, came to the empire, by excluding his
    little nephew Bernard, king of Italy, grandson of Pepin, elder
    brother to this Louis, whom their father made king of Italy, but
    who died in 810, leaving that kingdom to his son and grandson both
    named Bernard. Louis upon his accession to the throne eased the
    Saxons of their heavy taxes, and showed them so much lenity that
    he gained their hearts to the empire for ever, and from his
    courtesy and from this and other actions of clemency was surnamed
    <i>The Debonnaire</i>, or the Gracious. He lost his queen
    Irmingarde, who died at Angiers in&nbsp;818, by whom he had three
    sons, Lothaire, Pepin, and Louis.<a id="c18_5b"> </a>The first he
    made king of Italy,<a
      href="#fn_207"
      class="anchor">207</a>
    the second king of Aquitain, and Louis king of Bavaria; reserving
    to himself the rest of Bavaria and France. In&nbsp;819 he married
    Judith, daughter of Guelph, count of Aldorff, by whom he had
    Charles <i>the Bald</i>, afterward emperor and king of France.<a
    id="c18_5c"> </a>She was an ambitious and wanton woman; her
    adulteries gave great scandal to the people, and her overbearing
    insolence and continual intrigues embroiled the state, and drove
    the three eldest sons into open rebellion against their father.<a
      href="#fn_208"
      class="anchor">208</a>
    Nothing can excuse the methods to which these unnatural princes
    had recourse, under pretence of remedying the public disorders,
    which sprang from the weakness of their father, and the malice of
    a hated mother-in-law. But the scandals of her lewdness stirred up
    the zeal of our holy pastor to act the part of a second John the
    Baptist. The contemporary author of the life of Wala, abbot of
    Lorbie, who was deeply concerned in the secret transactions of
    that court, confidently charges her with incest and adultery with
    her relation and favorite minister, Bernard count of Barcelona.<a
    id="c18_5d"> </a>The author of the life of St.&nbsp;Frederic says,
    her marriage with Louis was incestuous, and within the forbidden
    degrees of affinity; but this circumstance could not have escaped
    the censure of her enemies; and from their silence is rejected by
    Mabillon and others as fabulous.</p>
  <p>
    Whatever the scandals of her gallantries were, St.&nbsp;Frederic,
    the neighborhood of whose see gave him free access to the court,
    then chiefly kept at Aix-la-Chapelle, admonished her of them with
    an apostolic freedom and charity, but without any other effect
    than that of drawing upon himself the fury and resentment of a
    second Jezebel, if we may believe the historians of that age. Our
    saint suffered also another persecution. The inhabitants of
    Wallacria, now called Walcheren, one of the principal islands of
    Zealand, belonging to the Netherlands, were of all others the most
    barbarous, and most averse to the maxims of the gospel. On which
    account St.&nbsp;Frederic, when he sent priests into the northern
    uncultivated provinces of his diocess, took this most dangerous
    and difficult part chiefly to himself; and nothing here gave him
    more trouble than the incestuous marriages contracted within the
    forbidden degrees, and the separation of the parties. To extirpate
    this inveterate evil he employed assiduous exhortations, tears,
    watching, prayer, and fasting; summoned an assembly of the
    principal persons of the island, and earnestly recommended the
    means to banish this abuse from among them, broke many such
    pretended marriages, and reconciled many persons that had done
    sincere penance to God and his Church. He composed a prayer to the
    Blessed Trinity with an exposition of that adorable mystery
    against heresies, which for many ages was used in the Netherlands
    with great devotion.<a id="c18_5e"> </a>The reputation of his
    sanctity made him to be considered as one of the most illustrious
    prelates of the Church, as appears from a poem of Rabanus Maurus,
    his contemporary, in praise of his virtue, published with notes
    among his poetical works, together with those of Fortunatus by
    F.&nbsp;Brower, S.&nbsp;J.<a
      href="#fn_209"
      class="anchor">209</a></p>
  <p>
    Whilst this holy pastor was intent only upon the duties of his
    charge, one day when he came from the altar having said mass, as
    he was going to kneel down in the chapel of St.&nbsp;John Baptist
    to perform his thanksgiving and other private devotions, he was
    stabbed in the bowels by two assassins. He expired in a few
    minutes, reciting that verse of the hundred and fourteenth
    psalm,—<i>I&nbsp;will please the Lord in the land of the
    living</i>.<a id="c18_5f"> </a>The author of his life says these
    assassins were employed by the empress Judith, who could not
    pardon the liberty he had taken to reprove her incest. William of
    Malmesbury<a
      href="#fn_210"
      class="anchor">210</a>
    and other historians assert the same; and this seems clearly to
    have been the true cause and manner of his martyrdom;<a

    Mabillon, Le Cointe, and Baillet think these assassins were rather
    sent by some of the incestuous inhabitants of Wallacria, but this
    opinion is destitute of the authority of ancient historians. The
    martyr’s body was buried in the same church of St.&nbsp;Saviour,
    called Oude-Munster, at Utrecht. His death happened on the 17th of
    July,&nbsp;838, as Mabillon has proved. See the life of
    St.&nbsp;Frederic with the notes of Cuper the Bollandist, Julij,

    ST.&nbsp;ODULPH, CANON&nbsp;OF&nbsp;UTRECHT,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born of noble French parents, and distinguished in his
    youth by the innocence of his manners, and his remarkable progress
    in learning and piety. Being ordained priest, he was made curate
    of Oresscoth in Brabant. St.&nbsp;Frederic afterward, by urgent
    entreaties, engaged him, for the greater glory of God, to be his
    strenuous assistant in reforming the manners of the fierce
    Frisons; in which undertaking it is incredible what fatigues he
    underwent, and what proofs he gave of heroic patience, meekness,
    zeal, and charity. Contemplation and prayer were the support and
    refreshment of his soul under his continual labors and
    austerities. Several wonderful predictions of things which
    happened long after his death, are recorded in his life. In his
    old age he resided at Utrecht, and died canon of the cathedral.
    To his last moments he allowed himself no indulgence, and never
    relaxed his fervor in labor; but rather redoubled his pace the
    nearer he saw his end approach, knowing this to be the condition
    of the Christian’s hire, and fearing to lose by sloth and for want
    of perseverance the crown for which he fought. His fasts, his
    watchings, his assiduity in prayer, his almsdeeds, his zeal in
    instructing the people, and exhorting all men to the divine love
    and the contempt of all earthly things, seemed to gather strength
    with his years. Being seized with a fever, he with joy foretold
    his last moment, and earnestly exhorting his brethren to fervor,
    and commending himself to their prayers, he promised, by the
    divine mercy, never to forget them before God, and happily
    departed this life in the ninth age, on the 12th of June, on which
    day his festival was kept with great solemnity at Utrecht and
    Staveren. Several churches and chapels bear his name; but the
    chapel at the New Bridge in Amsterdam, called Olofs-Kapel, was
    erected by the Danish sailors in memory of St.&nbsp;Olaus, king of
    Norway and Martyr, not of St.&nbsp;Odulph, as the Bollandists and
    some others have mistaken. See the life of St.&nbsp;Odulph in the

    ST.&nbsp;BRUNO, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;SEGNI,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was of the illustrious family of the lords of Asti in Piemont
    and born near that city. From his cradle he considered, that man’s
    happiness is only to be found in loving God; and to please him in
    all his actions was his only and his most ardent desire. He made
    his studies in the monastery of St.&nbsp;Perpetuus in the diocess
    of Asti. Bosch proves that he never was canon of Asti, but enjoyed
    some years a canonry at Sienna, as he himself informs us. In the
    Roman council in&nbsp;1079, he defended the doctrine of the
    Catholic Church concerning the blessed eucharist against
    Berengarius; and pope Gregory&nbsp;VII. nominated him bishop of
    Segni in the ecclesiastical state in&nbsp;1081. Bruno, who had
    been compelled to submit, after a long and strenuous resistance,
    served his flock, and on many important occasions the universal
    Church, with unwearied zeal. Gregory&nbsp;VII. who died
    in&nbsp;1085, Victor&nbsp;III. formerly abbot of mount Cassino,
    who died in&nbsp;1087, and Urban&nbsp;II. who had been scholar to
    St.&nbsp;Bruno (afterward institutor of the Carthusians) at
    Rheims, then a monk at Cluni, and afterward bishop of Ostia, had
    the greatest esteem for our saint. He attended Urban&nbsp;II. into
    France in 1095, and assisted at the council of Tours in&nbsp;1096.
    After his return into Italy he continued to labor for the
    sanctification of his soul and that of his flock, till not being
    able any longer to resist his inclination for solitude and
    retirement, he withdrew to mount Cassino, and put on the monastic
    habit. The people of Segni demanded him back; but Oderisus, abbot
    of mount Cassino, and several Cardinals, whose mediation the saint
    employed, prevailed upon the pope to allow his retreat. The abbot
    Oderisus was succeeded by Otho in&nbsp;1105, and this latter dying
    in&nbsp;1107, the monks chose bishop Bruno abbot.<a id="c18_7a">
    </a>He was often employed by the pope in important commissions,
    and by his writings labored to support ecclesiastical discipline<a

    and to extirpate simony. This vice he looked upon as the source of
    all the disorders which excited the tears of all zealous pastors
    in the Church, by filling the sanctuary with hirelings, whose
    worldly spirit raises an insuperable opposition to that of the
    gospel. What would this saint have said had he seen the collation
    of benefices, and the frequent translations of bishops in some
    parts, which serve to feed and inflame avarice and ambition in
    those in whom, above all others, a perfect disengagement from
    earthly things and crucifixion of the passions ought to lay a
    foundation of the gospel temper and spirit? Paschal&nbsp;II.
    formerly a monk of Cluni, succeeded Urban&nbsp;II. in the
    pontificate in&nbsp;1099. By his order St.&nbsp;Bruno having been
    abbot of mount Cassino about four years, returned to his
    bishopric, having resigned his abbacy, and left his abbatial
    crosier on the altar. He continued faithfully to discharge the
    episcopal functions to his death, which happened at Segni on the
    31st of August in&nbsp;1125. He was canonized by Lucius&nbsp;III.
    in&nbsp;1183, and his feast is kept in Italy on the 18th of July.

    ST.&nbsp;VINCENT OF PAUL, C.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FOUNDER OF THE LAZARITES, OR FATHERS OF THE MISSION.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    From his edifying life written by Abelly, bishop of Rodez, and
    again by the celebrated continuator of Tournely’s Theological
    Lectures, Dr.&nbsp;Peter Collet, in two volumes, quarto,

  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1660.</p>
  <p>
    Even in the most degenerate ages, when the true maxims of the
    gospel seem almost obliterated among the generality of those who
    profess it, God fails not, for the glory of his holy name, to
    raise to himself faithful ministers to revive the same in the
    hearts of many. Having, by the perfect crucifixion of the old man
    in their hearts, and the gift of prayer, prepared them to become
    vessels of his grace, he replenishes them with the spirit of his
    apostles that they may be qualified to conduct others in the paths
    of heroic virtue, in which the Holy Ghost was himself their
    interior Master. One of these instruments of the divine mercy was
    St.&nbsp;Vincent of Paul. He was a native of Poul, a village near
    Acqs in Gascony, not far from the Pyrenæan mountains. His parents,
    William of Paul and Bertranda of Morass, occupied a very small
    farm of which they were the proprietors, and upon the produce of
    which they brought up a family of four sons and two daughters. The
    children were brought up in innocence, and inured from their
    infancy to the most laborious part of country labor. But Vincent,
    the third son, gave extraordinary proofs of his wit and capacity,
    and from his infancy showed a seriousness and an affection for
    holy prayer far beyond his age. He spent great part of his time in
    that exercise when he was employed in the fields to keep the
    cattle. That he might give to Christ in the persons of the poor
    all that was in his power, he deprived himself of his own little
    conveniences and necessaries for that purpose in whatever it was
    possible for him to retrench from his own use. This early fervent
    consecration of himself to God, and these little sacrifices which
    may be compared to the widow’s two mites in the gospel, were
    indications of the sincere ardor with which he began to seek God
    from the first opening of his reason to know and love him; and
    were doubtless a means to draw down upon him from the author of
    these graces other greater blessings. His father was determined by
    the strong inclinations of the child to learning and piety, and
    the quickness of his parts, to procure him a school education. He
    placed him first under the care of the Cordeliers or Franciscan
    friars at Acqs, paying for his board and lodging the small pension
    of sixty French livres, that is, not six pounds English, a
    year.</p>
  <p>
    Vincent had been four years at the schools when Mr.&nbsp;Commet,
    a gentleman of that town, being much taken with his virtue and
    prudence, chose him sub-preceptor to his children, and enabled him
    to continue his studies without being any longer a burden to his
    parents. At twenty years of age, in&nbsp;1596, he was qualified to
    go to the university of Toulouse, where he spent seven years in
    the study of divinity, and commenced bachelor in that faculty. In
    that city he was promoted to the holy orders of subdeacon and
    deacon in&nbsp;1598, and of priesthood in 1600, having received
    the tonsure and minor orders a few days before he left Acqs. He
    seemed already endowed with all those virtues which make up the
    character of a worthy and zealous minister of the altar; yet he
    knew not the full extent of heroic entire self-denial, by which a
    man becomes dead and crucified to all inordinate self-will; upon
    which perfect self-denial are engrafted the total sacrifice of the
    heart to God, perfect humility, and that purity and ardor of
    divine charity which constitute the saint. Vincent was a good
    proficient in theology and other sciences of the schools, and had
    diligently applied himself to the study of the maxims of Christian
    virtue in the gospel, in the lives of the saints, and in the
    doctrine of the greatest masters of a spiritual life. But there
    remained a new science for him to learn, which was to cost him
    much more than bare study and labor. This consists in perfect
    experimental and feeling sentiments of humility, patience,
    meekness, and charity; which science is only to be learned by the
    good use of severe interior and exterior trials. This is the
    mystery of the cross, unknown to those whom the Holy Ghost has not
    led into this important secret of his conduct in preparing souls
    for the great works of his grace. The prosperity of the wicked
    will appear at the last day to have often been the most dreadful
    judgment, and a state in which they were goaded on in the pursuit
    of their evil courses; whilst, on the contrary, it will then be
    manifested to all men that the afflictions of the saints have been
    the greatest effects of divine mercy. Thus, by a chain of temporal
    disasters, did God lay in the soul of Vincent the solid foundation
    of that high virtue to which by his grace he afterward raised
    him.</p>
  <p>
    The saint went to Marseilles in&nbsp;1605, to receive a legacy of
    five hundred crowns which had been left him by a friend who died
    in that city. Intending to return to Toulouse, he set out in a
    felucca or large boat from Marseilles to Narbonne, but was met in
    the way by three brigantines of African pirates. The infidels
    seeing the Christians refuse to strike their flag, charged them
    with great fury, and on the first onset killed three of their men,
    and wounded every one of the rest; Vincent received a shot of an
    arrow. The Christians were soon obliged to surrender. The first
    thing the Mahometans did was to cut the captain in pieces because
    he had not struck at the first summons, and in combat had killed
    one of their men and four or five slaves. The rest they put in
    chains; and continued seven or eight days longer on that coast,
    committing several other piracies, but sparing the lives of those
    that made no resistance. When they had got a sufficient booty they
    sailed for Barbary. Upon landing they drew up an act of their
    seizure, in which they falsely declared that Vincent and his
    companions had been taken on board of a Spanish vessel, that the
    French consul might not challenge them. Then they gave to every
    slave a pair of loose breeches, a linen jerkin, and a bonnet. In
    this garb they were led five or six times through the city of
    Tunis to be shown; after which they were brought back to their
    vessel, where the merchants came to see them, as men do at the
    sale of a horse or an ox. They examined who could eat well, felt
    their sides, looked at their teeth to see who were of scorbutic
    habits of body, consequently unlikely for very long life; they
    probed their wounds, and made them walk and run in all paces, lift
    up burdens, and wrestle, to judge of their strength. Vincent was
    bought by a fisherman, who, finding that he could not bear the
    sea, soon sold him again to an old physician, a great chemist and
    extractor of essences, who had spent fifty years in search of the
    pretended philosopher’s stone. He was humane, and loved Vincent
    exceedingly; but gave him long lectures on his alchemy, and on the
    Mahometan law, to which he used his utmost efforts to bring him
    over; promising, on that condition, to leave him all his riches,
    and to communicate to him, what he valued much more than his
    estate, all the secrets of his pretended science. Vincent feared
    the danger of his soul much more than all the hardships of his
    slavery, and most earnestly implored the divine assistance against
    it, recommending himself particularly to the intercession of the
    Blessed Virgin, to which he ever after attributed his victory over
    this temptation. He lived with this old man from September
    1605&nbsp;to August&nbsp;1606, when, by this physician’s death, he
    fell to the share of a nephew of his master, a true man-hater. By
    resignation to the divine will, and confidence in providence, he
    enjoyed a sweet repose in his own heart under all accidents,
    hardships, and dangers; and by assiduous devout meditation on the
    sufferings of Christ, learned to bear all his afflictions with
    comfort and joy, uniting himself in spirit with his Divine
    Redeemer, and studying to copy in himself his lessons of perfect
    meekness, patience, silence, and charity. This new master sold him
    in a short time to a renegado Christian who came from Nice in
    Savoy. This man sent him to his temat or farm situate on a hot
    desert mountain. This apostate had three wives, of which one, who
    was a Turkish woman, went often to the field where Vincent was
    digging, and out of curiosity would ask him to sing the praises
    of God. He used to sing to her, with tears in his eyes, the psalm
    <i>Upon the rivers of Babylon</i>, &amp;c. the Salve Regina, and
    such like prayers. She was so much taken with our holy faith, and
    doubtless with the saintly deportment of the holy slave, that she
    never ceased repeating to her husband, that he had basely
    abandoned the only true religion, till like another Caiphas or ass
    of Balaam, without opening her own eyes to the faith, she made him
    enter into himself. Sincerely repenting of his apostasy, he agrees
    with Vincent to make their escape together. They crossed the
    Mediterranean sea in a small light boat which the least squall of
    wind would overset; and they landed safe at Aigues-Mortes, near
    Marseilles, on the 28th of June,&nbsp;1607, and thence proceeded
    to Avignon. The apostate made his abjuration in the hands of the
    vice-legate, and the year following went with Vincent to Rome, and
    there entered himself a penitent in the austere convent of the
    Fate-Ben-Fratelli, who served the hospitals according to the rule
    of St.&nbsp;John of God.</p>
  <p>
    Vincent received great comfort at the sight of a place most
    venerable for its pre-eminence in the church, which has been
    watered with the blood of so many martyrs, and is honored with the
    tombs of the two great apostles SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul and many
    other saints. He was moved to tears at the remembrance of their
    zeal, fortitude, humility, and charity, and often devoutly visited
    their monuments, praying earnestly that he might be so happy as to
    walk in their steps, and imitate their virtues. After a short stay
    at Rome, to satisfy his devotion, he returned to Paris, and took
    up his quarters in the suburb of St.&nbsp;Germain’s. There lodged
    in the same house a gentleman, the judge of a village near
    Bourdeaux, who happened to be robbed of four hundred crowns. He
    charged Vincent with the theft, thinking it could be nobody else;
    and in this persuasion he spoke against him with the greatest
    virulence among all his friends, and wherever he went. Vincent
    calmly denied the fact, saying, “God knows the truth.” He bore
    this slander six years, without making any other defence, or using
    harsh words or complaints, till the true thief being taken up at
    Bourdeaux on another account, to appease his own conscience and
    clear the innocent he sent for this judge, and confessed to him
    the crime. St.&nbsp;Vincent related this in a spiritual conference
    with his priests, but as of a third person; to show that patience,
    humble silence, and resignation are generally the best defence of
    our innocence, and always the happiest means of sanctifying our
    souls under slanders and persecution; and we may be assured that
    providence will in its proper time justify us, if expedient.</p>
  <p>
    At Paris Vincent became acquainted with the holy priest Monsieur
    de Berulle, who was afterward cardinal, and at that time was taken
    up in founding the Congregation of the French Oratory.
    A&nbsp;saint readily discovers a soul in which the spirit of God
    reigns. Berulle conceived a great esteem for St.&nbsp;Vincent from
    his first conversation with him; and to engage him in the service
    of his neighbor, he prevailed with him first to serve as curate of
    the parish of Clichi, a small village near Paris; and soon after
    to quit that employ to take upon him the charge of preceptor to
    the children of Emmanuel de Gondy, count of Joigny, general of the
    galleys of France. His lady, Frances of Silly, a person of
    singular piety, was so taken with the sanctity of Vincent, that
    she chose him for her spiritual director and confessor. In the
    year&nbsp;1616, whilst the countess of Joigny was at a country
    seat at Folleville, in the diocess of Amiens, Vincent was sent for
    to the village of Gannes, two leagues from Folleville, to hear the
    confession of a countryman who lay dangerously ill. The zealous
    priest, by carefully examining his penitent, found it necessary to
    advise him to make a general confession, with which the other
    joyfully complied. The penitent by this means discovered that all
    his former confessions had been sacrilegious for want of a due
    examination of his conscience; and afterward, bathed in tears, he
    declared aloud, in transports of joy before many persons and the
    countess of Joigny herself, that he should have been eternally
    lost if he had not spoken to Vincent. The pious lady was struck
    with dread and horror to hear of such past sacrileges, and to
    consider the imminent danger of being damned in which that poor
    soul had been; and she trembled lest some others among her vassals
    might have the misfortune to be in the like case. Far from the
    criminal illusion of pride by which some masters and mistresses
    seem persuaded that they owe no care, attention, or provision to
    those whose whole life is employed only to give them the fruit of
    their sweat and labors; she was sensible from the principles both
    of nature and religion, that masters or lords lie under strict
    ties of justice and charity towards all committed to their care;
    and that they are bound in the first place, as far as it lies in
    their power, to see them provided with the necessary spiritual
    helps for their salvation. But to wave the obligation, what
    Christian heart can pretend to the bowels of charity, and be
    insensible at the dangers of such persons? The virtuous countess
    felt in her own breast the strongest alarms for so many poor
    souls, which she called her own by many titles. She therefore
    entreated Vincent to preach in the church of Folleville, on the
    feast of the Conversion of St.&nbsp;Paul, in&nbsp;1617, and fully
    to instruct the people in the great duty of repentance and
    confession of sins. He did so; and such crowds flocked to him to
    make general confessions that he was obliged to call in the
    Jesuits of Amiens to his assistance. The Congregation of the
    mission dates its first institution from this time, and in
    thanksgiving for it, keeps the 25th of January with great
    solemnity.</p>
  <p>
    By the advice of Monsieur de Berulle, St.&nbsp;Vincent left the
    house of the countess in&nbsp;1617, to employ his talents among
    the common people in the villages of Bresse, where he heard they
    stood in great need of instruction. He prevailed upon five other
    zealous priests to bear him company, and with them formed a little
    community in the parish of Chatillon in that province.<a
    id="c19_1a"> </a>He there converted by his sermons the count of
    Rougemont and many others from their scandalous unchristian lives
    to a state of eminent penance and fervor, and in a short time
    changed the whole face of the country.<a
      href="#fn_215"
      class="anchor">215</a>
    The good countess his patroness was infinitely pleased with his
    success, and gave him sixteen thousand livres to found a perpetual
    mission among the common people in the place and manner he should
    think fit. But she could not be easy herself whilst she was
    deprived of his direction and advice; she therefore employed
    Monsieur de Berulle, and her brother-in-law cardinal de Retz, to
    prevail with him to come to her, and extorted from him a promise
    that he would never abandon the direction of her conscience so
    long as she lived, and that he would assist her at her death. But
    being extremely desirous that others, especially those who were
    particularly entitled to her care and attention, should want
    nothing that could contribute to their sanctification and
    salvation, she induced her husband to concur with her in
    establishing a company of able and zealous missionaries who should
    be employed in assisting their vassals and farmers. This project
    they proposed to their brother, John Francis of Gondi, the first
    archbishop of Paris, and he gave the college of Bons Enfans for
    the reception of the new community. All things being agreed on
    St.&nbsp;Vincent took possession of this house in April&nbsp;1625.
    The count and countess gave forty thousand French livres to begin
    the foundation.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Vincent attended the countess till her pious death, which
    happened on the 23d of June the same year; after which he joined
    his Congregation. He drew up for it certain rules or constitutions
    which were approved by pope Urban&nbsp;VIII., in&nbsp;1632. King
    Louis&nbsp;XIII. confirmed the establishment by letters patent,
    which he granted in May the same year; and, in&nbsp;1633, the
    regular canons of St.&nbsp;Victor gave to this new institute the
    priory of St.&nbsp;Lazarus, which being a spacious building was
    made the chief house of the Congregation, and from it the Fathers
    of the Mission were often called Lazarites or Lazarians. They are
    not religious men, but a Congregation of secular priests, who
    after two years’ probation make four simple vows, of poverty,
    chastity, obedience, and stability. They devote themselves to
    labor, in the first place, in sanctifying their own souls by the
    particular holy exercises prescribed in their institute; secondly,
    in the conversion of sinners to God; and thirdly, in training up
    clergymen for the ministry of the altar and the care of souls. To
    attain the first end, their rule prescribes them an hour’s
    meditation every morning, self-examination thrice every day,
    spiritual conferences every week, a yearly retreat of eight days,
    and silence except in the hours allowed for conversation. To
    comply with the second obligation, they are employed eight months
    every year in missions among the country people, staying three or
    four weeks in each place which they visit, every day giving
    catechism, making familiar sermons, hearing confessions,
    reconciling differences, and performing all other works of
    charity. To correspond with the third end which St.&nbsp;Vincent
    proposed to himself, some of this Congregation undertake the
    direction of seminaries, and admit ecclesiastics or others to make
    retreats of eight or ten days with them, to whom they prescribe
    suitable exercises; and for these purposes excellent rules are
    laid down by the founder. Pope Alexander&nbsp;VII., in&nbsp;1662,
    enjoined by a brief, that all persons who receive holy orders in
    Rome, or in the six suffragan bishoprics, shall first make a
    retreat of ten days under the direction of the fathers of this
    Congregation, under pain of suspension. St.&nbsp;Vincent settled
    his institute also in the seminary of St.&nbsp;Charles in Paris,
    and lived to see twenty-five houses of it founded in France,
    Piedmont, Poland, and other places.</p>
  <p>
    This foundation, though so extensive and beneficial, could not
    satisfy the zeal of this apostolic man. He by every other means
    studied to procure the relief of others under all necessities,
    whether spiritual or corporal. For this purpose he established
    many other confraternities, as that called Of Charity, to attend
    all poor sick persons in each parish; which institution he began
    in Bresse, and propagated in other places where he made any
    missions; one called Of the Dames of the Cross, for the education
    of young girls; another of Dames to serve the sick in great
    hospitals, as in that of Hotel Dieu in Paris. He procured and
    directed the foundation of several great hospitals, as in Paris
    that of foundlings, or those children who, for want of such a
    provision, are exposed to the utmost distress, or to the barbarity
    of unnatural parents; also that of poor old men; at Marseilles the
    stately hospital for the galley-slaves, who, when sick, are there
    abundantly furnished with every help both corporal and spiritual.
    All these establishments he settled under excellent regulations,
    and supplied with large sums of money to defray all necessary
    expenses. He instituted a particular plan of spiritual exercises
    for those that are about to receive holy orders; and others for
    those who desire to make general confessions, or to deliberate
    upon the choice of a state of life. He also appointed regular
    ecclesiastical conferences on the duties of the clerical state,
    &amp;c. It must appear almost incredible that so many and so great
    things could have been effected by one man, and a man who had no
    advantage from birth, fortune, or any shining qualities which the
    world admires and esteems. But our surprise would be much greater
    if we could enter into a detail of his wonderful actions, and the
    infinite advantages which he procured others. During the wars in
    Lorrain, being informed of the miseries to which those provinces
    were reduced, he collected charities among pious persons at Paris,
    which were sent thither, to the amount of fifteen or sixteen
    thousand livres, says Abelly; nay, as Collet proves from authentic
    vouchers, of two millions, that is, according to the value of
    money at that time, considerably above one hundred thousand pounds
    sterling; and he did the like on other occasions. He assisted King
    Louis&nbsp;XIII. at his death, and by his holy advice and
    exhortations that monarch expired in perfect sentiments of piety
    and resignation. Our saint was in the highest favor with the queen
    regent, Anne of Austria, who nominated him a member of the young
    king’s Council of Conscience, and consulted him in all
    ecclesiastical affairs, and in the collation of benefices; which
    office he discharged ten years.</p>
  <p>
    Amidst so many and so great employs his soul seemed always united
    to God; in the most distracting affairs it kept, as it were, an
    eye always open to him, in order to converse continually with him.
    This constant attention to him he often renewed, and always when
    the clock struck, by making the sign of the cross (at least
    secretly with his thumb upon his breast) with an act of divine
    love. Under all crosses, disappointments, and slanders, he always
    preserved a perfect serenity and evenness of mind, which it did
    not seem in the power of the whole world to disturb; for he
    considered all events only with a view to the divine will, and
    with an entire resignation to it, having no other desire but that
    God should be glorified in all things. Whether this was to be done
    by his own disgrace and sufferings, or by whatever other means it
    pleased the divine majesty, he equally rejoiced. Not that he fell
    into the pretended apathy or insensibility of the proud Stoics, or
    into the impious indifference of the false Mystics, afterwards
    called Quietists, than which nothing is more contrary to true
    piety, which is always tender, affectionate, and most sensible to
    all the interests of charity and religion. This was the character
    of our saint, who regarded the afflictions of all others as his
    own, sighed continually with St.&nbsp;Paul after that state of
    glory in which he should be united inseparably to his God, and
    poured forth his soul before him with tears over his own and
    others’ spiritual miseries. Having his hope fixed as a firm anchor
    in God, by an humble reliance on the divine mercy and goodness, he
    seemed raised above the reach of the malice of creatures, or the
    frowns of the world; and he enjoyed a tranquillity within his
    breast which no storms were able to ruffle or disturb. So perfect
    was the mastery which he had gained over his passions, that his
    meekness and patience seemed unalterable, whatever provocations he
    met with. He was never moved by affronts, unless to rejoice
    secretly under them, because he was sure to find in them a hidden
    treasure of grace, and an opportunity of vanquishing himself. This
    is the fruit of the victory which perfect virtue gains over
    self-love; and it is a more perfect sacrifice to God, a surer test
    of sincere virtue, a more heroic victory, and a more glorious
    triumph of the soul to bear a slander, an injurious suspicion, or
    an unjust insult, in silence and patience, than the most shining
    exterior act of virtue; a language often repeated, but little
    understood or practised among Christians. Perfect self-denial, the
    most profound humility, and an eminent spirit of prayer were the
    means by which St.&nbsp;Vincent attained to this degree of
    perfection; and he most earnestly recommended the same to his
    disciples. Humility he would have them to make the basis of his
    Congregation, and it was the lesson which he never ceased to
    repeat to them, that they ought to study sincerely to conceal even
    their natural talents. When two persons of extraordinary learning
    and abilities once presented themselves, desiring to be admitted
    into his Congregation, he gave them both a repulse, telling them,
    “Your abilities raise you above our low state. Your talents may be
    of good service in some other place. As for us, our highest
    ambition is to instruct the ignorant, to bring sinners to a spirit
    of penance, and to plant the gospel-spirit of charity, humility,
    meekness, and simplicity in the hearts of all Christians.” He laid
    it down also as a rule of humility, that, if possible, a man ought
    never to speak of himself or his own concerns, such discourse
    usually proceeding from, and nourishing in the heart, pride and
    self-love. This indeed is a rule prescribed by Confucius,
    Aristotle, Cato, Pliny, and other philosophers; because, say they,
    for any one to boast of himself is always the most intolerable and
    barefaced pride, and modesty in such discourse will be suspected
    of secret vanity. Egotism, or the itch of speaking always of a
    man’s self, shows he is intoxicated with the poison of self-love,
    refers everything to himself, and is his own centre, than which
    scarce anything can be more odious and offensive to others. But
    Christian humility carries this maxim higher, teaching us to love
    a hidden life, and to lie concealed and buried, as being in
    ourselves nothingness and sin.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Vincent exerted his zeal against the novelties concerning
    the article of divine grace which sprang up in his time. Michael
    Baius, doctor and professor of divinity at Louvain, advanced a new
    doctrine concerning the grace conferred on man in the two states
    before and after Adam’s fall, and some other speculative points;
    and pope Pius&nbsp;V. in&nbsp;1567, condemned seventy-six
    propositions under his name. Some of these, Baius confessed he had
    taught, and these he solemnly revoked and sincerely condemned with
    all the rest in&nbsp;1580, in presence of F. Francis Toletus,
    afterward cardinal, whom Gregory&nbsp;XIII. had sent for that very
    purpose to Louvain. Cornelius Jansenius and John Verger, commonly
    called Abbé de St.&nbsp;Cyran, contracted a close friendship
    together during their studies first at Louvain, afterward at
    Paris, and concerted a plan of a new system of doctrine concerning
    divine grace, founded, in part, upon some of the condemned errors
    of Baius. This system Jansenius, by his friend’s advice,
    endeavored to establish in a book, which from St.&nbsp;Austin, the
    great doctor of grace, he entitled, Augustinus.<a id="c19_1b">
    </a>After having been bishop of Ipres from&nbsp;1635 to&nbsp;1638,
    he died of the pestilence, having never published his book, in the
    close of which he inserted a declaration that he submitted his
    work to the judgment of the Church.<a
      href="#fn_216"
      class="anchor">216</a>
    <a id="c19_1c"> </a>Fromond, another Louvanian divine, and abler
    scholar, and a more polite writer, polished the style of this
    book, and put it in the press.<a
      href="#fn_217"
      class="anchor">217</a>
    <a id="c19_1d"> </a>Verger became director of the nuns of
    Port-Royal, had read some ancient writers on books of devotion,
    and wrote with ease.<a
      href="#fn_218"
      class="anchor">218</a>
    But his very works on subjects of piety, however neatly written,
    betray the author’s excessive presumption and forbidding
    self-sufficiency. He became the most strenuous advocate for
    Jansenism, and was detained ten years prisoner in the castle of
    Vincennes. He died soon after he had recovered his liberty,
    in&nbsp;1643. This man had by his reputation gained the esteem of
    St.&nbsp;Vincent; but the saint hearing him one day advance his
    errors, and add that the Church had failed for five or six hundred
    years past, he was struck with horror, and from that moment
    renounced the friendship of so dangerous a person. When these
    errors were afterward more publicly spread abroad, he strenuously
    exerted himself against them; on which account Gerberon, the
    Jansenistical historian, makes him the butt of his rancor and
    spleen.<a id="c19_1e"> </a>But general and vague invectives of the
    enemies to truth are the commendation of his piety and zeal.<a
      href="#fn_219"
      class="anchor">219</a>
    Our saint’s efforts to destroy that heresy, says Abelly, never
    made him approve a loose morality, which on all occasions he no
    less avoided and abhorred than the errors of the Jansenists. He
    was particularly careful in insisting on all the conditions of
    true repentance to render it sincere and perfect; for want of
    which he used to say with St.&nbsp;Ambrose, that some pretended
    penitents are rendered more criminal by their sacrilegious
    hypocrisy in the abuse of so great a sacrament, than they were by
    all their former sins.</p>
  <p>
    In the year&nbsp;1658 St.&nbsp;Vincent assembled the members of
    his Congregation at St.&nbsp;Lazarus, and gave to every one a
    small book of rules which he had compiled. At the same time he
    made a pathetic exhortation, to enforce the most exact and
    religious observance of them. This Congregation was again approved
    and confirmed by Alexander&nbsp;VII., and Clement&nbsp;X.
    St.&nbsp;Vincent was chosen by St.&nbsp;Francis of Sales director
    of his nuns of the Visitation that were established at Paris. The
    robust constitution of the zealous servant of God was impaired by
    his uninterrupted fatigues and austerities. In the eightieth year
    of his age he was seized with a periodical fever, with violent
    night sweats. After passing the night almost without sleep, and in
    an agony of pain, he never failed to rise at four in the morning,
    to spend three hours in prayer, to say mass every day (except on
    the three first days of his annual retreat, according to the
    custom he had established), and to exert, as usual, his
    indefatigable zeal in the exercises of charity and religion. He
    even redoubled his diligence in giving his last instructions to
    his spiritual children; and recited every day after mass the
    prayers of the Church for persons in their agony, with the
    recommendation of the soul, and other preparatory acts for his
    last hour. Alexander&nbsp;VII. in consideration of the extreme
    weakness to which his health was reduced, sent him a brief to
    dispense him from reciting his breviary; but before it arrived the
    servant of God had finished the course of his labors. Having
    received the last sacraments and given his last advice, he calmly
    expired in his chair, on the 27th of September&nbsp;1660, being
    fourscore and five years old. He was buried in the church of
    St.&nbsp;Lazarus in Paris, with an extraordinary concourse and
    pomp.<a id="c19_1f"> </a>An account of several predictions of this
    servant of God, and some miraculous cures performed by him whilst
    alive, may be read in his life written by Collet,<a
      href="#fn_220"
      class="anchor">220</a>
    with a great number of miracles wrought through his intercession
    after his death at Paris, Angiers, Sens, in Italy, &amp;c.<a
    id="c19_1g"> </a>Mr.&nbsp;Bonnet, superior of the seminary at
    Chartres, afterward general of the Congregation, by imploring this

    entire rupture, called by the physicians
    <i>entero-epiplo-celle</i>,<a
      href="#fn_221"
      class="anchor">221</a>
    which had been declared by the ablest surgeons absolutely
    incurable; this miracle was approved by cardinal Noailles. Several
    like cures of fevers, hemorrhages, palsies, dysenteries, and other
    distempers were juridically proved. A&nbsp;girl eight years old,
    both dumb and lame, was cured by a second Novena or nine days’
    devotion performed for her by her mother in honor of
    St.&nbsp;Vincent. His body was visited by cardinal Noailles in
    presence of many witnesses, in&nbsp;1712, and found entire and
    fresh, and the linen cloths in the same condition as if they were
    new. The tomb was then shut up again.<a id="c19_1h"> </a>This
    ceremony is usually performed before the beatification of a
    servant of God, though the incorruption of the body by itself is
    not regarded as a miraculous proof at Rome or elsewhere, as Collet
    remarks.<a
      href="#fn_222"
      class="anchor">222</a>
    After the ordinary rigorous examinations of the conduct, heroic
    virtues, and miracles of this saint at Rome, pope
    Benedict&nbsp;XIII. performed with great solemnity the ceremony of
    his beatification, in&nbsp;1729. Upon the publication of the brief
    thereof, the archbishop of Paris caused the grave to be again
    opened. The lady marechale of Noailles, the marshal her son, and
    many other persons were present; but the flesh on the legs and
    head appeared corrupted, which alteration from the state in which
    it was found twenty-seven years before, was attributed to a flood
    of water which twelve years before this had overflowed that vault.
    Miracles continued frequently to be wrought by the relics and
    invocation of St.&nbsp;Vincent. A&nbsp;Benedictin nun at
    Montmirel, afflicted with a violent fever, retention of urine,
    ulcers, and other disorders, her body being swelled to an enormous
    size, and having been a long time paralytic, was perfectly cured
    all at once by a relic of St.&nbsp;Vincent applied to her by
    Monseigneur Joseph Languet, then bishop of Soissons. Francis
    Richer, in Paris, was healed in a no less miraculous manner. Miss
    Louisa Elizabeth Sackville, an English young lady at Paris, was
    cured of a palsy by performing a novena at the tomb of
    St.&nbsp;Vincent; which miracle was attested in the strongest
    manner, among others, by Mrs. Hayes, a protestant gentlewoman with
    whom she lodged. Miss Sackville became afterward a nun in the
    French abbey called of the Holy Sacrament, in Paris, lived ten
    years without any return of her former disorder, and died
    in&nbsp;1742. St.&nbsp;Vincent was canonized in&nbsp;1737 by pope
    Clement&nbsp;XII.</p>

  <p>
    This saint could not display his zeal more to the advantage of his
    neighbor than by awaking Christians from the spiritual lethargy in
    which so many live. He set before their eyes the grievous disorder
    of lukewarmness in the divine service, and explained to them, like
    another Baptist, the necessity and obligations of sincere
    repentance; for those certainly can never be entitled to the
    divine favor who live in an ambiguous, divided, and distracted
    state of sinning and repenting; of being heathens and Christians
    by turns. Still more dreadful is the state of those who live in
    habitual sin, yet are insensible of their danger, and frightful
    miseries! Into what extravagance, folly, spiritual blindness, and
    sometimes incredulity, do men’s passions often plunge them! To
    what a degree of madness and stupidity do men of the finest
    natural parts sink, when abandoned by God! or rather when they
    themselves abandon God, and that light which he has set up in the
    world! Let us by tears and prayers implore the divine mercy in
    favor of all blind sinners.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;ARSENIUS, ANCHORET.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a Roman by birth, and was related to senators. He had been
    trained up in learning and piety, was sincerely virtuous, and well
    skilled, not only in the holy scriptures, but also in the profane
    sciences, and in the Latin and Greek languages and literature. He
    was in deacon’s orders, and led a retired life at home with his
    sister, in Rome, when the emperor Theodosius the Great wanted a
    person to whom he might intrust the care of his children, and
    desired the emperor Gratian to apply for that purpose to the
    bishop of Rome, who recommended Arsenius. Gratian sent him to
    Constantinople, where he was kindly received by Theodosius, who
    advanced him to the rank of a senator, with orders that he should
    be respected as the father of his children, whose tutor and
    preceptor he appointed him. No one in the court at that time wore
    richer apparel, had more sumptuous furniture, or was attended by a
    more numerous train of servants than Arsenius; he was attended by
    no fewer than a thousand, all richly clad. Theodosius coming one
    day to see his children at their studies, found them sitting,
    whilst Arsenius talked to them standing. Being displeased thereat,
    he took from them for some time the marks of their dignity, and
    caused Arsenius to sit, and them to listen to him standing.</p>
  <p>
    Arsenius had always a great inclination to a retired life, which
    the care of his employment and the incumbrances of a great fortune
    made him desire the more ardently; for titles and honors were
    burthensome to him. At length, about the year 390, an opportunity
    offered itself. Arcadius having committed a considerable fault,
    Arsenius whipped him for it. The young prince, resenting the
    chastisement, grew the more obstinate. Arsenius laid hold of this
    occasion to execute the project he had long before formed of
    forsaking the world. The Lives of the Fathers, both in Rosweide
    and Cotelier, make no mention of this resentment of Arcadius,
    which circumstance is only related by Metaphrastes; on which
    account it is omitted by Tillemont and others. It is most certain
    that retirement had long been the object of the saint’s most
    earnest wishes and desires; but before he left the court, he for a
    long time begged by earnest prayer to know the will of God; and
    one day making this request with great fervor, he heard a voice,
    saying, “Arsenius, flee the company of men, and thou shalt be
    saved.” He obeyed the call of heaven without delay, and going on
    board a vessel, sailed to Alexandria, and thence proceeded to the
    desert of Sceté, where he embraced an anachoretical life. This
    happened about the year&nbsp;394, he being in the fortieth year of
    his age, and having lived eleven years at the court. There he
    renewed his prayers to God, begging to be instructed in the way of
    salvation, having no other desire than to make it his only study
    to please God in all things.<a id="c19_2a"> </a>Whilst he prayed
    thus, he again heard a voice which said, “Arsenius, flee, hold thy
    peace, and be quiet; these are the principles of salvation,”<a
      href="#fn_223"
      class="anchor">223</a>
    that is, the main things to be observed in order to be saved.
    Pursuant to the repeated advice or injunction of fleeing and
    avoiding human conversation, he made choice of a very remote cell,
    and admitted very few visits even from his own brethren. When he
    went to the church, upwards of thirty miles distance from his
    habitation, he would place himself behind one of the pillars, the
    better to prevent his seeing or being seen by any one. Theodosius,
    in great affliction for the loss of him, caused search to be made
    for him both by sea and land; but being soon after called into the
    West to revenge the death of Valentinian&nbsp;II., and to
    extinguish the rebellion of Arbogastus his murderer, and Eugenius,
    died of a dropsy at Milan in 395. Arcadius being left emperor of
    the East, advanced Rufin, who was the prefectus-prætorio, and had
    been his flattering governor, to the rank of prime minister,
    committing to him the direction not only of his armies, but also
    of the whole empire. He at the same time earnestly desired to call
    back to court his holy master Arsenius, that he might be assisted
    by his wise and faithful counsels. Being informed that he was in
    the desert of Sceté, he wrote to him, recommending himself to his
    prayers, begging his forgiveness, and offering him the disposal of
    all the tribute of Egypt, that he might make a provision for the
    monasteries and the poor at his discretion; but the saint had no
    other ambition on earth than to be allowed the liberty of enjoying
    his solitude, that he might employ his time in bewailing his sins,
    and in preparing his soul for eternity. He therefore answered the
    emperor’s message only by word of mouth, saying, “God grant as all
    the pardon of our sins; as to the distribution of the money,
    I&nbsp;am not capable of such a charge, being already dead to the
    world.” When he first presented himself to the ancients or
    superiors of the monks of Sceté, and begged to be allowed to serve
    God under their direction, they recommended him to the care of
    St.&nbsp;John the Dwarf, who, when the rest in the evening sat
    down to take their repast, took his place among them, and left
    Arsenius standing in the middle without taking notice of him. Such
    a reception was a severe trial to a courtier; but was followed by
    another much rougher; for, in the middle of the repast,
    St.&nbsp;John took a loaf or portion of bread, and threw it on the
    ground before him, bidding him, with an air of indifference, eat
    if he would. Arsenius cheerfully fell on the ground, and in that
    posture took his meal. St.&nbsp;John was so satisfied with his
    behavior in this single instance, that he required no further
    trial for his admission, and said to his brethren: “Return to your
    cells with the blessing of the Lord. Pray for us. This person is
    fit for a religious life.”</p>
  <p>
    Arsenius, after his retreat, only distinguished himself among the
    anchorets by his greater humility and fervor. At first he used,
    without perceiving it, to do certain things which he had practised
    in the world, which seemed to savor of levity or immortification,
    as, for instance, to sit cross-legged, or laying one knee over
    another. The seniors were unwilling, through the great respect
    they bore him, to tell him of this in a public assembly in which
    they were met to hold a spiritual conference together; but abbot
    Pemen or Pastor made use of this stratagem: He agreed with another
    that he should put himself in that posture; and then he rebuked
    him for his immodesty; nor did the other offer any excuse.
    Arsenius perceived that the reproof was meant for him, and
    corrected himself of that custom. In other respects he appeared
    from the beginning an accomplished master in every exercise of
    virtue in that venerable company of saints. To punish himself for
    his seeming vanity at court, because he had there gone more richly
    habited than others, his garments were always the meanest of all
    the monks in Sceté. He employed himself on working-days till noon
    in making mats of palm-tree leaves; and he always worked with a
    handkerchief in his bosom, to wipe off the tears which continually
    fell from his eyes. He never changed the water in which he
    moistened his palm-tree leaves, but only poured in fresh water
    upon it as it wasted. When some asked him one day why he did not
    cast away the corrupted water, he answered, “I&nbsp;ought to be
    punished by this ill smell for the sensuality with which
    I&nbsp;formerly used perfumes when I&nbsp;lived in the world.” To
    satisfy for former superfluities he lived in the most universal
    poverty, so that in a violent fit of illness having occasion for
    a small sum to procure him some little necessaries, he was obliged
    to receive it in alms, whereupon he gave God thanks for being made
    worthy to be thus reduced to the necessity of asking alms in his
    name. The distemper continued so long upon him that the priest of
    this desert of Sceté caused him to be carried to his apartment
    contiguous to the church, and laid him on a little bed made of
    the skins of beasts, with a pillow under his head. One of the
    monks coming to see him, was much scandalized at his lying so
    easy, and said, “Is this the abbot Arsenius?” The priest took him
    aside, and asked him what his employment had been in the village
    before he was a monk? The old man answered, “I&nbsp;was a
    shepherd, and lived with much pains and difficulty.” Then the
    priest said, “Do you see this abbot Arsenius? when he was in the
    world he was the father of the emperors: he had a thousand slaves
    clothed in silk, with bracelets and girdles of gold, and he slept
    on the softest and richest beds. You who was a shepherd, did not
    find in the world the ease which you now enjoy.” The old man,
    moved by these words, fell down, and said, “Pardon me, father,
    I&nbsp;have sinned; he is in the true way of humiliation;” and he
    went away exceedingly edified. Arsenius in his sickness wanting a
    linen garment, accepted something given him in charity, to buy
    one, saying, “I&nbsp;return thanks to thee, O&nbsp;Lord, for thy
    grace and mercy, in permitting me to receive alms in thy name.”
    One of the emperor’s officers, at another time, brought him the
    will of a senator, his relation, who was lately dead and had left
    him his heir. The saint took the will, and would have torn it to
    pieces, but the officer threw himself at his feet, and begged him
    not to tear it, saying, such an accident would expose him to be
    tried for his life. St.&nbsp;Arsenius, however, refused the
    estate, saying, “I&nbsp;died before him, and cannot be made his
    heir.”</p>
  <p id="c19_2b">
    Though no one knew the saint’s fasts, they must have been
    excessive, as the measure of corn, called thallin,<a
      href="#fn_224"
      class="anchor">224</a>
    sent him for the year, was exceeding small; this, however, he
    managed so well as not only to make it suffice for himself, but
    also to impart some of it to his disciples when they came to visit
    him. When new fruit was brought him he just tasted it, and gave
    thanks to God; but he took so little as to show he did it only to
    avoid the vanity of singularity. Great abstinence makes little
    sleep to suffice nature. Accordingly St.&nbsp;Arsenius often
    passed the whole night in watching and prayer, as we learn from
    his disciple Daniel. At other times, having watched a considerable
    part of the night, when nature could hold out no longer, he would
    allow himself a short repose, which he took sitting, after which
    he resumed his wonted exercises. On Saturday evenings, as the same
    disciple relates, it was his custom to go to prayers at sun-set,
    and continue in that exercise with his hands lifted up to heaven
    till the sun beat on his face the next morning. His affection for
    the holy exercise of prayer, and his dread of the danger of
    vain-glory, gave him the strongest love of retirement. He had two
    disciples who lived near him, and did all his necessary business
    abroad. Their names were Alexander and Zoilus; he afterward
    admitted a third, called Daniel. All three were famous for their
    sanctity and discretion, and frequent mention is made of them in
    the histories of the fathers of the deserts of Egypt.
    St.&nbsp;Arsenius would seldom see strangers who came to visit
    him, saying, he would only use his eyes to behold the heavens.</p>
  <p>
    Theophilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, came one day in company
    with a certain great officer and others to visit him, and begged
    he would entertain them on some spiritual subject for the good of
    their souls. The saint asked them whether they were disposed to
    comply with his directions; and being answered in the affirmative,
    he replied; “I&nbsp;entreat you, then, that wherever you are
    informed of Arsenius’s abode, you would leave him to himself, and
    spare yourselves the trouble of coming after him.” On another
    occasion, when the same patriarch sent to know if he would open
    his door to him if he came, St.&nbsp;Arsenius returned for answer,
    that if he came alone he would; but that if he brought others with
    him he would seek out some other place, and would stay there no
    longer. Melania, a noble Roman lady, travelled as far as Egypt
    only to see Arsenius, and by means of Theophilus, contrived to
    meet him as he was coming out of his cell. She threw herself at
    his feet. The saint said to her, “A woman ought not to leave her
    house. You have crossed these great seas that you may be able to
    say at Rome that you have seen Arsenius, and raise in others a
    curiosity to come and see me.” Not daring to lift up her eyes, as
    she lay on the ground, she begged he would always remember her and
    pray for her. He answered, “I&nbsp;pray that the remembrance of
    you be blotted out of my mind.” Melania returned to Alexandria in
    great grief at this answer: but Theophilus comforted her, saying,
    “He only prayed that he might forget your person on account of
    your sex; but as for your soul, doubt not but he will pray for
    you.”</p>
  <p>
    The saint never visited his brethren, contenting himself with
    meeting them at spiritual conferences. The abbot Mark asked him
    one day in the name of the hermits, why he so much shunned their
    conversation? The saint answered: “God knoweth how dearly
    I&nbsp;love you all; but I&nbsp;find I&nbsp;cannot be both with
    God and with men at the same time; nor can I&nbsp;think of leaving
    God to converse with men.” This disposition, however, did not
    hinder him from giving short lessons of virtue to his brethren,
    and several of his apophthegms are recorded among those of the
    ancient fathers. He said often, “I&nbsp;have always something to
    repent of after having conversed with men; but have never been
    sorry for having been silent.” He had frequently in his mouth
    those words which St.&nbsp;Euthymius and St.&nbsp;Bernard used
    also to repeat to themselves, to renew their fervor in the
    discharge of the obligations of their profession: “Arsenius, why
    hast thou forsaken the world, and wherefore art thou come hither?”
    Being asked one day why he, being so well versed in the sciences,
    sought the instruction and advice of a certain monk who was an
    utter stranger to all human literature? he replied, “I&nbsp;am not
    unacquainted with the learning of the Greeks and Romans; but
    I&nbsp;have not yet learned the alphabet of the science of the
    saints, whereof this seemingly ignorant person is master.”</p>
  <p>
    Though the saint was excellently versed in sacred learning, and in
    the maxims and practice of perfect Christian virtue, he never
    would discourse on any point of scripture, and chose rather to
    hear than to instruct or speak, making it the first part of his
    study to divest his mind of all secret opinion of himself, or
    confidence in his own abilities or learning; and this he justly
    called the foundation of humility and all Christian virtue.
    Evagrius of Pontus, who had distinguished himself at
    Constantinople by his learning, and had retired to Jerusalem, and
    thence into the deserts of Nitria in&nbsp;385, expressed his
    surprise to our saint, that many very learned men made no progress
    in virtue, whilst many Egyptians who knew not the very letters of
    the alphabet arrived at a high degree of sublime contemplation. To
    whom Arsenius made this answer: “We make no progress in virtue,
    because we dwell in that exterior learning which puffs up the
    mind; but these illiterate Egyptians have a true sense of their
    own weakness, blindness, and insufficiency; by which they are
    qualified to labor successfully in the pursuit of virtue.” This
    saint used often to cry out to God with tears, in the most
    profound sentiment of humility, “O&nbsp;Lord, forsake me not;
    I&nbsp;have done nothing that can be acceptable in thy sight; but
    for the sake of thy infinite mercy enable and assist me that
    I&nbsp;may now begin to serve thee faithfully.”</p>
  <p>
    Nothing is so remarkable or so much spoken of by the ancients
    concerning our saint, as the perpetual tears which flowed from his
    eyes almost without intermission. The source from which they
    sprung was the ardor with which he sighed after the glorious light
    of eternity, and the spirit of compunction with which he never
    ceased to bewail the sins of his life past, and the daily
    imperfections into which he fell. But nothing was more amiable or
    sweet than these tears of devotion, as appeared in the venerable
    and majestic serenity of his countenance.<a id="c19_2c"> </a>His
    example was a proof of what the saints assure us concerning the
    sweetness of the tears of divine love. “When you hear tears
    named,” says St.&nbsp;Chrysostom,<a
      href="#fn_225"
      class="anchor">225</a>
    “do not represent to yourselves any thing grievous or terrible.
    They are sweeter than any carnal delights which the world can
    enjoy.”<a id="c19_2d"> </a>St.&nbsp;Austin says to the same
    purpose:<a
      href="#fn_226"
      class="anchor">226</a>
    “The tears of devotion are sweeter than the joys of theatres.”<a
    id="c19_2e"> </a>St.&nbsp;John Climacus unfolds to us at large the
    incomparable advantages and holy pleasure of pious tears, and
    among other things writes thus:<a
      href="#fn_227"
      class="anchor">227</a>
    “I&nbsp;am astonished when I&nbsp;consider the happiness of holy
    compunction; and I&nbsp;wonder how carnal men can think it
    affliction. It contains in it a pleasure and spiritual joy as wax
    does honey. God in an invisible manner visits and comforts the
    heart that is broken with this holy sorrow.” Saint Arsenius being
    asked by a certain person what he must do to deliver himself from
    a troublesome temptation of impure thoughts, the saint gave him
    this answer,—“What did the Midianites do? They decked and adorned
    their daughters, and led them to the Israelites, though they used
    no violence upon them. Those among the servants of God that
    treated them with severity, and revenged their treachery and
    criminal designs with their blood, put a stop to their lewdness.
    Behave in the same manner with regard to your evil thoughts.
    Repulse them vigorously, and punish yourself for this attempt made
    in yourself towards a revolt.”</p>
  <p>
    This great saint lived in a continual remembrance and apprehension
    of death and the divine judgment. This made Theophilus, the busy
    patriarch of Alexandria, cry out when he lay on his death-bed
    in&nbsp;312: “Happy Arsenius! who has had this moment always
    before his eyes.” His tears did not disfigure his countenance,
    which, from the inward peace and joy of his soul, mixed with sweet
    compunction; and from his assiduous conversation with God,
    appeared to have something angelical or heavenly; being equally
    venerable for a certain shining beauty, and an inexpressible air
    of majesty and meekness, in a fair and vigorous old age.<a
    id="c19_2f"> </a>The great and experienced master in a
    contemplative life, St.&nbsp;John Climacus, proposes
    St.&nbsp;Arsenius as an accomplished model, and calls him a man
    equal to the angels,<a
      href="#fn_228"
      class="anchor">228</a>
    saying that he shunned so rigorously the conversation of men, only
    that he might not lose something more precious, which was God, who
    always filled his soul. Our saint called it a capital and
    indispensable duty of a monk never to intermeddle in any temporal
    concerns, and never to listen to any news of the world. He was
    tall and comely, but stooped a little in his old age; had a
    graceful mien, his hair was all white, and his beard reached down
    to his girdle; but the tears which he shed continually had worn
    away his eyelashes. He was forty years old when he quitted the
    court, and he lived in the same austere manner from that time to
    the age of ninety-five; he spent forty years in the desert of
    Sceté, except that about the year&nbsp;395, he was obliged to
    leave it for a short time, on account of an irruption of the
    Mazici, a barbarous people of Lybia; but the plunderers were no
    sooner returned home but he hastened back to his former solitude,
    where he remained till a second inroad of the same barbarians, in
    which they massacred several hermits, compelled him entirely to
    forsake this abode about the year&nbsp;434. He retired weeping to
    the rock of Troë, called also Petra, over against Memphis, and ten
    years after, to Canopus near Alexandria; but not being able to
    bear the neighborhood of that great city, he stayed here only
    three years; then returned to Troë, where he died two years after.
    Knowing that his end was drawing near he said to his disciples,
    —“One only thing I&nbsp;beg of your charity, that when I&nbsp;am
    dead I&nbsp;may be remembered in the holy sacrifice. If in my life
    I&nbsp;have done any thing that is accepted by God, through his
    mercy, that I&nbsp;shall now find again.” They were much grieved
    to hear him speak as if they were going soon to lose him. Upon
    which he said, “My hour is not yet come. I&nbsp;will acquaint you
    of it; but you shall answer at the tribunal of Christ, if you
    suffer any thing belonging to me to be kept as a relic.” They said
    with tears (being solicitous for a funeral procession), “What
    shall we do alone, father? for we know not how to bury the dead.”
    The saint answered, “Tie a cord to my feet, and drag my carcass to
    the top of the mountain, and there leave it.” His brethren seeing
    him weep in his agony, said to him, “Father, why do you weep? are
    you like others, afraid to die?” The saint answered, “I&nbsp;am
    seized with great fear: nor has this dread ever forsaken me from
    the time I&nbsp;first came into these deserts.” The saints all
    serve God in fear and trembling, in the constant remembrance of
    his judgment; but this is always accompanied with a sweet
    confidence in his infinite love and mercies. The Holy Ghost indeed
    so diversifies his gifts and graces as to make these dispositions
    more sensible in some than in others. Notwithstanding this fear,
    St.&nbsp;Arsenius expired in great peace, full of faith, and of
    that humble confidence which perfect charity inspires, about the
    year&nbsp;449. He was ninety-five years old, of which he had spent
    fifty-five in the desert. Abbot Pemen having seen him expire, said
    with tears, “Happy Arsenius! who have wept for yourself so much
    here on earth! Those who weep not here shall weep eternally
    hereafter.” This saint was looked upon by the most eminent monks
    of succeeding ages as a most illustrious pattern of their state.
    The great St.&nbsp;Euthymius endeavored in all his exercises to
    form himself upon the model of his life, and to copy in himself
    his humility, his meekness and constant evenness of mind, his
    abstinences and watching, his compunction and tears, his love of
    retirement, his charity, discretion, fervor, assiduous application
    to prayer, and that greatness of soul which appeared with so much
    lustre in all his actions. The name of St.&nbsp;Arsenius occurs in
    the Roman Martyrology on the 19th of July. See his life written by
    St.&nbsp;Theodore the Studite; and another in Metaphrastes; also

    ST.&nbsp;SYMMACHUS, POPE,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Sardinia, and archdeacon of the Roman church
    under pope Anastasius, and succeeded him in the holy see
    in&nbsp;498. Festus, the patrician, had been gained by Anastasius,
    emperor of Constantinople, and a protector of the Eutychians, to
    endeavor to procure from pope Anastasius a confirmation of the
    Henoticon of Zeno, an imperial edict in favor of those heretics,
    as Theophanes relates. That pope dying, Festus, by bribes, gained
    several voices to raise Laurence, archpriest of St.&nbsp;Praxedes,
    to the pontificate. They were both ordained the same day;
    Symmachus in the basilic of Constantine, and Laurence in that of
    our lady. Theodoric, king of Italy, though an Arian, ordered that
    election should take place which was first, and made by the
    greater number. By this rule Symmachus was acknowledged lawful
    pope. He called a council at Rome of seventy-three bishops, and
    sixty-seven priests, which, to prevent cabals and factions in the
    elections of popes, ordained that if any one promised his vote to
    another, or deliberated in any assembly upon that subject, whilst
    the pope is living, he should be deposed and excommunicated; and
    that after the pope’s death that person should be duly elected who
    had a majority of the voices of the clergy.<a id="c19_3a">
    </a>Laurence subscribed these decrees the first among the
    priests,<a
      href="#fn_229"
      class="anchor">229</a>
    and was afterward made bishop of Nocera. Soon after, some of the
    clergy and senators, by the contrivance of Festus and Probinus,
    privately recalled Laurence to Rome, and renewed the schism, which
    is by many historians reckoned the first that happened in that
    church, though Novatian had attempted to form one. The schismatics
    accused Symmachus of many crimes, and king Theodoric commanded a
    synod should be held at Rome upon that occasion.<a id="c19_3b">
    </a>The bishops of Liguria, Emilia, and Venetia took Ravenna in
    their way to Rome, and strongly represented to the king, that the
    pope himself ought to call the council, which right he enjoyed
    both by the primacy of his see, derived from St.&nbsp;Peter, and
    by the authority of councils; also,<a id="c19_3c"> </a>that there
    never had been an instance of his being subjected to the judgment
    of his inferiors.<a
      href="#fn_230"
      class="anchor">230</a>
    The king showed them the pope’s letters by which he agreed to,
    and summoned the council.<a id="c19_3d"> </a>Indeed the pontifical
    says, that Symmachus assembled this council.<a
      href="#fn_231"
      class="anchor">231</a></p>
  <p id="c19_3e">
    The synod met at Rome in September, 501, and declared pope
    Symmachus acquitted of the accusations entered against him,
    condemning to be punished as schismatics any who should celebrate
    mass without his consent; but pardoning those who had raised the
    schism, provided they gave satisfaction to the pope.<a
      href="#fn_232"
      class="anchor">232</a>
    When this decree was carried into Gaul, all the bishops were
    alarmed at it; and they charged Saint Avitus, bishop of Vienne, to
    write about it in the name of them all. He addressed his letter to
    Faustus and Symmachus, two patricians who had both been consuls,
    complaining, that when the Pope had been accused before the
    prince, the bishops, instead of opposing such an injustice, had
    taken upon them to judge him: “For,” says he, “it is not easy to
    apprehend how the superior can be judged by his inferiors,
    especially the head of the Church.” However, he commends the
    council for bearing testimony to his innocence, and earnestly
    entreats the senate to maintain the honor of the Church, and not
    to suffer the flocks to rise up against their pastors.<a
    id="c19_3f"> </a>The famous deacon Paschasius, a man eminent for
    his great alms-deeds and other good works, had the misfortune
    blindly to abet this schism to the latter end of his life; for
    which St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great relates, upon the authority of a
    certain revelation,<a
      href="#fn_233"
      class="anchor">233</a>
    that he was detained in purgatory after his death, but delivered
    by the prayers of St.&nbsp;Germanus, bishop of Capua.<a
    id="c19_3g"> </a>Ceillier thinks that he repented only in his last
    moments;<a
      href="#fn_234"
      class="anchor">234</a>
    or, that simplicity of heart extenuated his sin. Paschasius wrote
    a learned book on the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, though the two
    books on that subject which now bear his name, are the work of
    Faustus of Riez.</p>
  <p>
    Pope Symmachus wrote to the emperor Anastasius declaring that he
    could not hold communion with him so long as he maintained that of
    Acacius. That prince expected such a menace from the zeal of the
    pope, and therefore he had not written to him upon his promotion,
    according to custom. He also accused him of Manicheism, though
    Symmachus had banished the Manichees out of Rome; and he did not
    cease to thwart the pope, dreading his known zeal against his
    favorite sect of the Acephali.<a id="c19_3h"> </a>Symmachus
    composed an apology against this emperor, in which he shows the
    dignity of the Christian priesthood.<a
      href="#fn_235"
      class="anchor">235</a>
    <a id="c19_3i"> </a>He wrote to the Oriental bishops, exhorting
    them to suffer banishment and all persecutions rather than to
    betray the divine truth.<a
      href="#fn_236"
      class="anchor">236</a>
    King Thrasimund having banished many Catholic African bishops into
    Sardinia, pope Symmachus sent them annually both clothes and
    money; and there is still extant among the works of Ennodius a
    letter which this pope sent to comfort them. He accompanied it
    with some relics of the martyrs SS.&nbsp;Nazarius and Romanus. He
    redeemed many captives; and gave one hundred and seventy-nine
    pounds of silver in ornaments to several churches in Rome; and to
    the chapel of the holy cross, a gold cross of ten pound weight, in
    which he inclosed a piece of the true cross. On a ciborium, that
    is, in the language of that time, a tabernacle, which he gave to
    St.&nbsp;Paul’s church, he caused to be engraved the figures of
    our Saviour and the twelve apostles. He instituted that the hymn
    of divine praise called the Gloria in Excelsis should be sung on
    every Sunday, and on the festivals of martyrs, as the pontifical
    testifies. He filled the papal chair fifteen years and eight
    months; and died on the 19th of July,&nbsp;514. See his letters,
    the councils, and Anastasius Bibl. Also F.&nbsp;Amort’s Diss. on

    ST.&nbsp;MACRINA, VIRGIN.</h3>
  <p>
    She was the eldest of all the ten children of St.&nbsp;Basil the
    elder, and St.&nbsp;Emmelia; and being trained up in excellent
    sentiments of piety, after the death of her father, consecrated
    her virginity by vow to God, and was a great assistant to her
    mother in educating her younger brothers and sisters.
    St.&nbsp;Basil the Great, St.&nbsp;Peter of Sebaste,
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, and the rest, learned from her their
    early contempt of the world, dread of its dangers, and application
    to prayer and the word of God. When they were sent abroad for
    their improvement, Macrina induced her mother to concur with her
    in founding two monasteries, one for men, the other for women, at
    a little distance from each other, on their own estate, near Ibora
    in Pontus. That of men was first governed by St.&nbsp;Basil,
    afterward by St.&nbsp;Peter. Macrina drew up the rules for the
    nunnery with admirable prudence and piety, and established in it
    the love and spirit of the most universal poverty, and
    disengagement from the world, mortification, humility, assiduous
    prayer, and singing of psalms. God was pleased to afflict her with
    a most painful cancer: which at length her mother cured by making,
    at her request, the sign of the cross upon the sore; only a black
    spot remained ever after upon the part that had been affected.</p>
  <p>
    After the death of St.&nbsp;Emmelia, Macrina disposed of all that
    was left of their estate in favor of the poor, and lived herself,
    like the rest of the nuns, on what she earned by the labor of her
    hands. Her brother Basil died in the beginning of the
    year&nbsp;379, and she herself fell ill eleven months after.
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, making her a visit, after eight years’
    absence, found her sick of a raging fever, lying on two boards,
    one of which served for her bed, and the other for her pillow. He
    was exceedingly comforted by her pious discourses, and animated by
    the fervor and ardent sighs of divine love and penance, by which
    she prepared herself for her last hour. She calmly expired, after
    having armed herself with the sign of the cross. Such was the
    poverty of the house that nothing was found to cover her corpse
    when it was carried to the grave, but her old hood and coarse
    veil; but St.&nbsp;Gregory threw over it his episcopal cloak. She
    had worn about her neck a fillet, on which hung an iron cross and
    a ring. St.&nbsp;Gregory gave the cross to a nun named Vestiana,
    but kept himself the ring, in which the metal was hollow, and
    contained in it a particle of the true cross. Araxus, bishop of
    the place, and St.&nbsp;Gregory led up the funeral procession,
    which consisted of the clergy, the monks, and nuns, in two
    separate choirs. The whole company walked singing psalms, with
    torches in their hands. The holy remains were conveyed to the
    church of the Forty Martyrs, a mile distant from the monastery,
    and were deposited in the same vault with the saint’s mother.
    Prayers were offered up for them both. St.&nbsp;Macrina died in
    December,&nbsp;379; but is commemorated both by the Latins and
    Greeks on the 19th of July. This account is given us by
    St.&nbsp;Gregory of Nyssa, in the funeral discourse he made upon
    her, t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;149. Add the remarks of F.&nbsp;Bosch, the
    Bollandist, t.&nbsp;4, Julij, p.&nbsp;589.</p>

    This saint, from his extraordinary piety, was surnamed the
    Just.</p>
  <p>
    The lives of the apostles and primitive Christians were a miracle
    in morals, and a sensible effect of almighty grace. Burning with
    holy zeal, they had no interest on earth but that of the divine
    honor, which they sought in all things; and being warmed with the
    expectation of an eternal kingdom, they were continually
    discoursing of it, and comforting one another with the hopes of
    possessing it; and they did little else but prepare to die. Thus
    by example, still more than by words, they subdued their very
    enemies to the faith, and brought them to a like spirit and
    practice. Their converts, by a wonderful change of manners, became
    in a moment new creatures. Those who had been the most bitter

    ST.&nbsp;MARGARET, V.&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    According to the ancient Martyrologies, she suffered at Antioch in
    Pisidia, in the last general persecution. She is said to have been
    instructed in the faith by a Christian nurse, to have been
    persecuted by her own father, a priest of the idols; and after
    many torments, to have gloriously finished her martyrdom by the
    sword. Her name occurs in the Litany inserted in the old Roman
    order, and in the most ancient calendars of the Greeks. From the
    east her veneration was exceedingly propagated in England, France,
    and Germany, in the eleventh century, during the holy wars. Her
    body is now kept at Monte-Fiascone in Tuscany. Vida, the glory of
    the Christian muses, has honored St.&nbsp;Margaret who is one of
    the tutelar saints of Cremona, his native city, with two hymns;
    begging of God through her prayers, not long life, riches, or
    honors, but the grace of a happy death and a holy life, that he
    might be admitted, with a devout and pious heart, to praise God in
    the choir of his holy servants. See his hymns, and Pinius the

    SS.&nbsp;JUSTA AND RUFINA,&nbsp;MM.</h3>
  <p>
    These holy martyrs were two Christian women at Seville in Spain,
    who maintained both themselves and many poor persons by selling
    earthenware. A&nbsp;fervent soul finds in the most ordinary course
    of life occasions of exercising many heroic acts of virtue, and
    makes every ordinary action a perfect holocaust by performing it
    with a most ardent desire of pleasing God with the entire
    sacrifice of itself. Such were the lives of these two faithful
    servants of God in the world. So perfect a virtue deserved to be
    honored with the crown of martyrdom. Though these saints gave all
    their substance to the poor, and were desirous to serve every one
    for the edification of their souls, yet no motives could draw them
    into any criminal condescension. Not to concur to the idolatrous
    superstitions, they refused to sell vessels for the use of
    heathenish sacrifices. The Pagans, offended at their religious
    scruple, when Dioclesian’s edicts renewed the persecution, broke
    all the ware in their shop, and impeached them for their faith
    before the governor. The prefect, after they had boldly confessed
    Christ, commanded them to be stretched on the rack, and their
    sides in the meantime to be torn with iron hooks. An idol was
    placed near the rack with incense, that if they would offer
    sacrifice, they should be that moment released; but their fidelity
    was not to be shaken. Justa expired on the rack: which, when the
    judge saw, he ordered Rufina to be strangled, and their bodies to
    be burnt. They suffered in the year&nbsp;304. See their acts
    published by Maldonat; also Ado, Usuard, &amp;c.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;CESLAS&nbsp;C. OF THE ORDER OF ST.&nbsp;DOMINIC.</h3>
  <p>
    He was of the house of the counts of Odrovans, and brother to
    St.&nbsp;Hyacinth, and lived near Cracow in Poland. Having devoted
    himself to God in an ecclesiastical state, he became eminent for
    piety, learning, and the innocence of his manners. He was first
    instituted to a canonry at Cracow, but afterward promoted to be
    conservator of Sendomir. His riches he employed on the poor,
    leading himself a most abstemious penitential life. Happening to
    accompany his uncle Yvo Konski, chancellor of Poland, into Italy,
    he received at Rome, together with St.&nbsp;Hyacinth, the habit of
    St.&nbsp;Dominic from the hands of that holy founder in 1218.
    Returning into Germany and Poland, he preached penance with
    wonderful fruit. In&nbsp;1222 he founded at Prague a convent of
    one hundred and twenty-six friars, in which Andrew, the bishop of
    Prague, took the religious habit, having first, with the consent
    of pope Honorius&nbsp;III. resigned his see. St.&nbsp;Ceslas built
    in the same city a nunnery of the same order, in which, soon after
    his death, queen Margaret, daughter of Leopold, archduke of
    Austria, and widow of Henry, king of the Romans, professed
    herself, out of humility, a lay-sister. The saint sent Adrian with
    twenty-six other friars of his order to preach the faith in
    Bosnia, where they all received the crown of martyrdom.
    St.&nbsp;Ceslas himself preached in Silesia, and resided long at
    Breslaw. He directed St.&nbsp;Hedwiges in the paths of Christian
    perfection, was endowed with the gifts of prophecy and miracles,
    and filled the northern kingdoms with many eminent servants of
    God.</p>
  <p>
    In&nbsp;1240 the Tartars, marching from Asia with an army of five
    hundred thousand men, fell like a torrent on the West, and spread
    universal desolation over Russia, Bulgaria, Sclavonia, Poland, and
    Hungary, to the borders of Germany. They slew Henry&nbsp;II.,
    surnamed the Pious, duke of Silesia, in a great battle at Wolstadt
    in&nbsp;1241, and marched against Breslaw, his capital. The
    inhabitants burned or hid their most precious effects, and,
    abandoning the city to the enemy, shut themselves up in the
    citadel. St.&nbsp;Ceslas bore them company to assist and comfort
    them, and never ceased with tears to implore the divine
    protection. God was pleased to hear his prayers. When the
    barbarians had made a breach, and were preparing to scale the
    walls, the saint coming from offering the divine mysteries
    appeared upon the walls, and at the same time a globe of fire fell
    from the heavens upon the camp of the infidels, which it filled
    with confusion and terror. In the meantime the Christians made a
    sally, and the numberless troops of the barbarians perceiving that
    heaven visibly fought against them, whilst many were perishing by
    the flame, betook themselves to flight, and abandoned their
    enterprise. Thus they who had overturned so many thrones, and
    trampled to the ground so many powerful armies, saw themselves
    tumbled down from their victories and pride by the prayer of one
    humble servant of God, who renewed on this occasion the miracles
    of Elias and Eliseus. The circumstances of this wonderful
    deliverance are authentically attested by ancient records, still
    preserved among the public archives of the city of Breslaw, and
    are related by Martin Cromer, bishop of Heilsberg or Warmia, in
    his history of Poland, Longinus, and other historians of the
    northern kingdoms. St.&nbsp;Ceslas died in July, the following
    year,&nbsp;1242. His relics are preserved in a stately chapel at
    Breslaw. The immemorial veneration of his name was approved by
    Clement&nbsp;XI. in&nbsp;1713. See Touron, Vie de

    SAINT ULMAR, OR&nbsp;WULMAR, ABBOT&nbsp;OF&nbsp;SAMER.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    THREE MILES FROM BOULOGNE.</p>
  <p>
    He was nobly born at Sylviaco in the territory of Boulogne in
    Picardy. Renouncing the world in his youth, he entered himself a
    brother in the abbey of Hautmont in Haynault, where it was his
    employment to keep the cattle, and to hew wood for the community.
    He was distinguished for his eminent spirit of prayer, and being
    compelled by obedience to receive holy orders, was promoted to the
    priesthood. He after this obtained leave to live alone in a
    hermitage near mount Cassel, and afterward in&nbsp;688 founded in
    a wood upon his father’s estate in Sylviaco in the Boulognois, the
    abbey of Samer, corruptly so called for St.&nbsp;Ulmar’s, at
    present of the Congregation of St.&nbsp;Maur. St.&nbsp;Ulmar
    founded a nunnery at Vileria, now Wiere aux bois, a mile from his
    own monastery, in which he placed his niece Bertana abbess.
    Ceadwalla, king of the West-Saxons, passing that way in his
    journey to Rome to receive baptism, conferred on St.&nbsp;Ulmar a
    notable largess toward carrying on his foundation. In close
    retirement in his hermitage near mount Cassel, the saint preserved
    himself always free from worldly passions by flying from the
    occasions which chiefly excite them, and by withdrawing from the
    great scene of earthly business, envy, avarice, and strife. Here
    shutting out the busy swarm of vain images which besets us in the
    world, he inured his mind to happy recollection and heavenly
    contemplation. In this sweet repose he daily advanced in fervor
    and divine charity till he was called to the joys of his Lord on
    the 20th of July,&nbsp;710. He was glorified by miracles, and is
    named in the Roman and other Martyrologies on the 20th of July. On
    the 17th of June his relics were conveyed to Boulogne for fear of
    the plunder of the Normans; and from thence to the abbey of
    St.&nbsp;Peter’s at Ghent, where they were burnt by the fury of
    the Calvinists in the sixteenth century. See his life written soon

    ST.&nbsp;JEROM ÆMILIANI, C.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FOUNDER OF THE CONGREGATION OF&nbsp;REGULAR&nbsp;CLERGY
    OF&nbsp;SOMASCHA.</p>
  <p>
    He was born at Venice of a patrician family; and, in the most
    troublesome times of the republic, served in the troops from his
    childhood. Whilst he was governor of the new castle in the
    mountains of Tarviso, he was taken prisoner, cast into a dungeon,
    and loaded with chains. His sufferings he sanctified by penance
    and prayer; and being delivered by the miraculous protection of
    the mother of God, arriving at Tarviso, he hung up his chains
    before an altar consecrated to God under the invocation of the
    Blessed Virgin, and, returning to Venice, devoted himself to the
    exercises of prayer and all virtues. At that time a famine and a
    contagious distemper having reduced many families to the greatest
    distress, he laid himself out in relieving all, but was
    particularly moved with compassion for abandoned orphans. These he
    gathered in a house which he hired, clothed and fed them at his
    own expense, and instructed them himself with unwearied zeal in
    the Christian doctrine and in all virtue. By the advice of
    St.&nbsp;Cajetan and others, he passed to the continent and
    erected like hospitals for orphans at Brescia, Bergamo, and other
    places; and others for the reception of penitent women. At
    Somascha, on the frontiers of the Venetian dominions, between
    Bergamo and Milan, he founded a house which he destined for the
    exercises of those whom he received into his Congregation, and in
    which he long resided. From this house it took its name; though it
    was sometimes called St.&nbsp;Mayeul’s, titular of a college at
    Pavia, which St.&nbsp;Charles Borromeo put under his
    direction.</p>
  <p>
    The instruction of youth and young clergymen became also an object
    of his zeal in his foundations, and continues still to be in his
    institute. The brothers, during the life of the founder, were all
    laymen, and it was only approved as a pious Congregation. The holy
    founder died at Somascha on the 8th of February,&nbsp;1537, of a
    contagious distemper which he had caught by attending the sick. He
    was beatified by Benedict&nbsp;XIV.; and canonized by
    Clement&nbsp;XIII. An office in his honor was appointed for the
    20th of July, by a decree of the holy see published in&nbsp;1769.
    Three years after his death, in&nbsp;1540, his Congregation was
    declared a religious Order by Paul&nbsp;III., and confirmed under
    the rule of St.&nbsp;Augustine by St.&nbsp;Pius&nbsp;V. in 1571,
    and again by Sixtus&nbsp;V. in&nbsp;1586. It has no houses out of
    Italy and the Catholic Swiss Cantons. It is divided into three
    provinces, of Lombardy, Venice, and Rome. The general is chosen
    every three years out of each province in its turn. See his life

    She was daughter of Pudens, a Roman senator, and sister to
    St.&nbsp;Pudentiana, and in the days of pope Pius&nbsp;I. and the
    emperor Antoninus Pius, edified the church of Rome, by the bright
    lustre of her virtues. All her great riches she employed in
    relieving the poor and the necessities of the Church. By the
    comfort and succors which she afforded the martyrs she endeavored
    to make herself partaker of their crowns, and she lived in the
    assiduous exercise of prayer, watching, and fasting. She died in
    peace and was buried near her sister on the Salarian road. Bede
    and other martyrologists style her a virgin. An old <i>title</i>

    The primitive Christians lived only for heaven, and in every step
    looked up to God, regardless of all lower pursuits or meaner
    advantages that could interfere with their great design of knowing
    and loving him. This constant attention to God awed them in their
    retirements; this gave life and wings to their devotion, and
    animated them to fervor in all their actions; this carried them
    through the greatest difficulties and temptations, and supported

    king Sapor&nbsp;II., by the command of Sapor Tamsapor governor of
    Adiabene, Barhadbesciabas, the zealous deacon of the city of
    Arbela, was apprehended and put on the rack. Whilst he was
        tormented, the officers continually cried out to him, “Worship
        water and fire, and eat the blood of beasts, and you shall be
      immediately set at liberty.” But the blessed deacon
    Barhadbesciabas showed, by the cheerfulness of his countenance,
    that the interior joy of his happy soul overcame the torments he
    felt in his body. He often said to the judge, “Neither you nor
    your king, nor any manner of torments shall ever be able to
    separate me from the love of Jesus: Him alone have I&nbsp;served
    from my infancy to this old age.” The tyrant at length condemned
    him to be beheaded, and commanded Aghæus, an apostate Christian
    nobleman, to be his executioner. The holy deacon stood bound
    waiting with joy for the happy moment which was to associate him
    to the angels; but Aghæus trembled so as not to be able to give
    the blow. He struck, however, seven times at the martyr’s neck,
    and not being able to sever his head from his body, ran his sword
    into his bowels; of which wound the holy deacon expired soon
    after. The judge set guards to watch the blessed corpse; but two
    clerks carried it off in the night, and buried it after the Roman
    fashion. He suffered on the 20th day of the month of July, in the

    ST.&nbsp;VICTOR OF MARSEILLES,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    The emperor Maximian, reeking with the blood of the Thebæan
    legion, and many other martyrs whom he had massacred in different
    parts of Gaul, arrived at Marseilles, the most numerous and
    flourishing church in those provinces. The tyrant breathed here
    nothing but slaughter and fury, and his coming filled the
    Christians with fear and alarms. In this general consternation,
    Victor, a Christian officer in the troops, went about in the night
    time from house to house visiting the faithful, and inspiring them
    with contempt of a temporal death and the love of eternal life. He
    was surprised in this action, so worthy a soldier of Jesus Christ,
    and brought before the prefects Asterius and Eutychius, who
    exhorted him not to lose the fruit of all his services and the
    favor of his prince for the worship of a dead man; so they called
    Jesus Christ. He answered, that he renounced those recompenses if
    he could not enjoy them without being unfaithful to Jesus Christ,
    the eternal Son of God, who vouchsafed to become man for our
    salvation, but who raised himself from the dead, and reigns with
    the Father, being God equally with him. The whole court heard him
    with tumultuous shouts of indignation and rage. However, the
    prisoner being a person of distinction, the prefects sent him to
    Maximian himself. The incensed countenance of an emperor did not
    daunt the champion of Christ; and the tyrant seeing his threats to
    have no effect upon him, commanded him to be bound hands and feet
    and dragged through all the streets of the city, exposed to the
    blows and insults of the populace. Every one of the heathens
    seemed to think it a crime not to testify their false zeal, by
    offering some indignity or other to the martyr. Their design was
    to intimidate the Christians, but the example of the martyr’s
    resolution served to encourage them.</p>
  <p>
    Victor was brought back bruised and bloody to the tribunal of the
    prefects, who thinking his resolution must have been weakened by
    his sufferings, began to blaspheme our holy religion, and pressed
    him again to adore their gods. But the martyr filled with the Holy
    Ghost, and encouraged by his presence in his soul, expressed his
    respect for the emperor and his contempt of their gods, adding,
    “I&nbsp;despise your deities, and confess Jesus Christ: inflict
    upon me what torments you please.” The two prefects only disagreed
    about the choice of the tortures. After a warm contest Eutychius
    withdrew, and left the prisoner to Asterius, who commanded him to
    be hoisted on the rack, and most cruelly tortured a long time. The
    martyr, lifting up his eyes to heaven, asked patience and
    constancy of God, whose gift he knew it to be. Jesus Christ
    appeared to him on the rack, holding a cross in his hands, gave
    him his peace, and told him that he suffered in his servants, and
    crowned them after their victory. These words dispelled both his
    pains and his grief; and the tormentors being at last weary, the
    prefect ordered him to be taken down, and thrown into a dark
    dungeon. At midnight God visited him by his angels; the prison was
    filled with a light brighter than that of the sun, and the martyr
    sung with the angels the praises of God. Three soldiers who
    guarded the prison, seeing this light, were surprised at the
    miracle, and casting themselves at the martyr’s feet asked his
    pardon, and desired baptism. Their names were Alexander, Longinus,
    and Felician. The martyr instructed them as well as time would
    permit, sent for priests the same night, and going with them to
    the sea-side he led them out of the water, that is, was their
    godfather, and returned with them again to his prison.</p>
  <p>
    The next morning Maximian was informed of the conversion of the
    guards, and, in a transport of rage, sent officers to bring them
    all four before him in the middle of the market-place. The mob
    loaded Victor with injuries, and would fain have compelled him to
    bring back his converts to the worship of their gods; but he said,
    “I&nbsp;cannot undo what is well done.” And turning to them he
    encouraged them saying, “You are still soldiers; behave with
    courage, God will give you victory. You belong to Jesus Christ, be
    faithful. An immortal crown is prepared for you.” The three
    soldiers persevered in the confession of Jesus Christ, and by the
    emperor’s orders were forthwith beheaded. Victor prayed in the
    mean time with tears that he might, by being united with them in
    their happy death, be presented in their glorious company before
    God; but after having been exposed to the insults of the whole
    city as an immovable rock lashed with the waves, and been beaten
    with clubs and scourged with leather thongs, he was carried back
    to prison, where he continued three days, recommending to God his
    martyrdom with many tears. After that term the emperor called him
    again before his tribunal, and having caused a statue of Jupiter,
    with an altar and incense, to be placed by him, he commanded the
    martyr to offer incense to the idol. Victor went up to the profane
    altar, and by a stroke of his foot threw it down. The emperor
    ordered the foot to be forthwith chopped off; which the saint
    suffered with great joy, offering to God these first fruits of his
    body. A&nbsp;few moments after, the emperor condemned him to be
    put under the grindstone of a handmill, and crushed to death. The
    executioners turned the wheel, and when part of his body was
    bruised and crushed, the mill broke down. The saint still breathed
    a little; but his head was immediately ordered to be cut off. His
    and the other three bodies were thrown into the sea, but being
    cast ashore were buried by the Christians in a grotto hewn out of
    a rock. The author of the acts adds, “They are honored to this day
    with many miracles, and many benefits are conferred by God and our
    Lord Jesus Christ on those who ask them through their merits.”</p>

    This institute and abbey were commenced by William of Champeaux,
    archdeacon of Paris, a man of eminent piety and learning, who
    having taught for many years rhetoric and theology, with
    extraordinary reputation, in the cloister of the cathedral,
    retired to this little chapel of St.&nbsp;Victor, then in the
    skirts of the town. There with certain fervent clergymen he lived
    in close solitude, assiduous prayer, and great austerity, allowing
    no other food to be served in his community but herbs, pulse, and
    roots, with bread and salt. By the pressing importunities of the
    bishop of Paris and other persons of distinction, he was obliged
    to resume his theological lectures, which he seems to have
    continued at St.&nbsp;Victor’s as F.&nbsp;Gourdan shows. Whence
    Rollin calls this monastery the cradle of the university of Paris.
    In favor of this holy institute king Louis&nbsp;VI. founded and
    built there a magnificent abbey, which still subsists in a most
    flourishing condition. Gilduin, a most holy man, was appointed
    first abbot, whilst William of Champeaux taught there, who
    in&nbsp;1113 was consecrated bishop of Chalons on the Saone.<a
    id="c21_4c"> </a>Dying in&nbsp;1121, according to his desire he
    was buried at Clairvaux, by St.&nbsp;Bernard, who had received at
    his hands the abbatial benediction.<a

    ST.&nbsp;ARBOGASTUS, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;STRASBURG,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    The Irish challenge this saint as a native of their island. The
    Scots also lay claim to him, and are supported by Richer’s
    Chronicle of Sens, written in the thirteenth century, and by the
    life of St.&nbsp;Florentius, his successor, though his acts say he
    was of a noble family in Aquitain. Travelling into Alsace he led
    an anachoretical life in the Sacred Forest (for this is the
    interpretation of the Teutonic name Heiligesforst), about the
    year&nbsp;630. He was often called to the court of king
    Dagobert&nbsp;II., and by his interest promoted to the episcopal
    see of Strasburg. His acts relate, that not long after his
    exaltation he raised to life Dagobert’s son, killed by a fall from
    a horse; these acts call this prince Sigebert; his name is not
    recorded by the historians. Many other miracles are ascribed to
    this saint; who, assisted by the liberality of this king, enriched
    the Church of Strasburg with several large estates. King Dagobert
    bestowed on it, for his sake, the manor and town of Rufach, with
    an extensive country situated on both sides the river Alse or
    Elle, together with the old royal palace of Isenburg, residing
    himself at Kirchem near Molsheim. St.&nbsp;Arbogastus also
    founded, or at least endowed, several monasteries, the principal
    among which were Surburg and Shutteran: some say also
    Ebersheimunster; but the chief founder of this last was duke
    Athico, the father of St.&nbsp;Odilia, by the direction of
    St.&nbsp;Deodatus, bishop of Nevers. St.&nbsp;Arbogastus died,
    according to Bosch the Bollandist, in&nbsp;678, the year before
    Dagobert offered the bishopric of Strasburg to St.&nbsp;Wilfrid,
    who was then on his journey to Rome. Upon his declining that
    dignity, it was conferred on St.&nbsp;Florentius. All writers on
    St.&nbsp;Arbogastus’s life mention that, in his last will, he
    ordered his body should be interred on the mountain which was the
    burial-place of malefactors. His will was complied with; but the
    church of St.&nbsp;Michael was afterward built upon the spot, and
    surrounded by a village called Strateburg. Near it was founded the
    abbey of St.&nbsp;Arbogastus, to which his body was translated
    with honor by his successor St.&nbsp;Florentius. See the life of
    St.&nbsp;Arbogastus which seems to have been written in the tenth
    age, published with remarks by F.&nbsp;Bosch, t.&nbsp;5, Julij,

    ST.&nbsp;MARY MAGDALEN.</h3>
  <p>
    The illustrious penitent woman mentioned by St.&nbsp;Luke,<a
      href="#fn_244"
      class="anchor">244</a>
    was, by her perfect conversion, an encouraging example and model
    of penitence to all succeeding ages.<a id="c22_1a"> </a>She is
    called the Sinner,<a
      href="#fn_245"
      class="anchor">245</a>
    to express her pre-eminence in guilt. This epithet seems to imply
    that she led a lewd and disorderly life. The scandal of her
    debaucheries had rendered her name infamous throughout the whole
    city. Naim, Tiberias, or some neighboring place in Galilee, seems
    to have been the chief theatre of her disorders, at least at the
    time of her conversion. They took their rise from small
    beginnings; for no one becomes a great proficient in vice all at
    once. The fences of virtue are weakened by degrees before they are
    entirely broken down.</p>
  <p>
    The steps by which young persons, like this sinner, are led into
    evil courses, are pointed out to us by our Divine Redeemer in the
    parable of the prodigal son. The source of all his misfortunes is
    a love of independence and of his own will. He is full of his own
    wisdom, and of a certain self-sufficiency; is an enemy to advice,
    the means to find out truth and to discover dangers. All who
    contradict his passions, or tell him the truth, are odious to him;
    the counsels of tender parents he calls interested; those of God’s
    anointed too severe and scrupulous; those of the old and
    experienced, cowardly and mean-spirited. Young persons, above all
    others, are in an age in which the devil prepares innumerable
    snares, the world lays many stratagems, and passions easily
    eclipse reason; and it behoves them infinitely to be strongly
    persuaded that their safety consists altogether in most sincere
    dispositions of humility, obedience, and docility. Tractableness
    and dutifulness towards superiors is the most essential virtue of
    that age, next to the obligation of religion, which we owe to God.
    Those companions, whose discourse and behavior tend to inspire a
    contempt of parents and other superiors, are of all pests the most
    dangerous to youth.</p>
  <p>
    The prodigal son, blinded by his passions, thought himself prudent
    and strong enough to be his own governor and master, and flattered
    himself that his love of liberty and pleasure was not very
    criminal or unjust; but from this root all vices have sprouted up,
    and are not to be restrained by him who opens to them such a door
    by shaking off the happy yoke of subjection, which is the divine
    ordinance. Such is the strange disorder of that mischievous
    passion, that though the prodigal son lived in dignity and plenty,
    and enjoyed all temporal blessings and all the comforts of life
    without feeling its troubles or knowing its miseries, yet he was
    not content. His subjection to a good father was true freedom; he
    was the object of all his parent’s cares, and he reaped the fruit
    of all his labors. But so distempered was his soul, that the
    constraint of this tender guardian’s watchful eye seemed to
    embitter all his pleasures, and such an obedience appeared to him
    an insupportable burden and slavery, which therefore he would
    shake off to have no other law but his own will. This was his
    capital enemy, though he would not be so persuaded; and by
    indulging it he fostered a young tiger in his own bosom, which
    soon grew too strong for him and tore him to pieces. We are
    astonished at the quick progress which the passions make when once
    the bridle is let loose. The prodigal youth, seeing himself
    possessed of that dangerous liberty which he had so passionately
    desired, full of false joy at the prospect of imaginary happiness,
    went into a foreign country, to be at a greater distance from all
    troublesome advisers. His passions being so far yielded to, had no
    longer any bounds, and he denied his heart nothing of its
    irregular desires, being no longer master of himself. Unthinking
    and blinded he soon squandered away his fortune, without keeping
    any accounts, or knowing how it was spent; he was surprised to
    find his hands empty, and himself starving, and that he had not
    yet found those enjoyments which he had promised himself; instead
    of which he had met with nothing but shadows and miseries.
    Nevertheless, cleaving still to so treacherous a world, and yet
    entertaining desperate foolish hopes of finding happiness in it,
    he went on in the pursuit of his passions; and losing himself
    daily more and more in the mazes of sin, he was at length reduced
    to have no other company but that of the most filthy of beasts,
    and almost to perish with hunger at the heels of the hogs which he
    was condemned to serve and fatten.</p>
  <p>
    This is a true picture of the sinner who has thrown off the holy
    yoke of God, and has enslaved himself to his passions. How
    earnestly ought every Christian to pray that God may always so
    strengthen his resolution with his grace, that he may never
    receive any other than his sweet and holy law? What completes the
    misfortune of the habitual sinner is, that few who have fallen
    into that gulf ever sincerely rise again. The very afflictions
    which converted the prodigal son throw thousands into despair.
    God’s powerful graces are weakened after having been long
    contemned; and habits grow stronger than reason. When the poison
    of sin has sunk deep into the heart, it is not expelled by an
    ordinary grace.<a id="c22_1b"> </a>Of such a sinner that curse is
    pronounced, that even in his old age, if he ever arrive at it, his
    bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth, and they shall
    descend with him into the grave, and shall sleep with him in the
    dust.<a
      href="#fn_246"
      class="anchor">246</a>
    Christ indeed came from heaven to save all such; in his tender
    compassion for their miseries he invites them to return to him,
    and for their encouragement has shown a remarkable example of his
    mercy in our saint. Having considered in the image of the prodigal
    son, the unhappy steps by which she fell, we shall, with greater
    edification, take a view of the circumstances which have given so
    great a lustre to her repentance.</p>
  <p>
    Jesus, not long after he had raised to life the son of a widow at
    Naim, a town in Galilee, was invited to dinner by a certain
    Pharisee called Simon, who seems to have lived in the same town,
    or some neighboring city, as Calmet shows. Our Lord was pleased to
    accept his invitation, chiefly that he might confound the pride of
    the Pharisees by manifesting the power of his grace in the
    wonderful conversion of this abandoned sinner. His bowels had
    yearned over her spiritual miseries, and he spread upon her soul a
    beam of his divine light which penetrated her understanding and
    her heart so effectually, that, listening to the interior voice of
    his grace, she saw the abominable filth and miseries in which she
    was plunged, was filled with confusion and horror, and conceived
    the most sincere detestation of her ingratitude and baseness. Our
    Lord went to the banquet in great joy to wait for this soul, which
    he himself had secretly wounded with his holy love, and which he
    was pleased to draw to him in the midst of a great assembly, that
    by her public repentance she might repair the scandal she had
    given, and he might give to all succeeding ages an illustrious
    instance of his mercy towards all repenting sinners. She began her
    conversion by entering into herself. As her fall was owing to
    inconsideration, so doubtless her first step towards repentance
    was serious reflection on the misery of her present condition, the
    happiness she had forfeited, and the punishment she was to expect.
    From these considerations she raised her thoughts to others higher
    and more noble, those of divine love, reflecting who He is whom
    she had so grievously offended, and how excessive and
    incomprehensible his goodness is, which she had so long and so
    basely slighted. This motive of love, to which Christ ascribed her
    conversion, drew from her eyes a torrent of tears, and made her
    cry out with the prodigal son, that she had sinned against heaven.
    That model of true penitents forgot his corporeal miseries and all
    other circumstances of his fall, being full of this reflection
    alone, how he could be capable of offending so good a parent. He
    acknowledged himself unworthy to be again called a child; yet he
    deferred not a moment to restore his heart to him to whom he owed
    it, and, confiding in his indulgence, threw himself upon his
    mercy, hoping by his goodness to be admitted among his hired
    servants.</p>
  <p>
    In the like dispositions does our penitent raise her heart to God.
    She hearkens not to the suggestions of worldly prudence which
    might seem to require some time for deliberation, for settling her
    concerns, or for taking proper measures about her conversion
    itself; the least delay appears to her a new crime, a fresh
    aggravation of her misfortune. She was informed that our Divine
    Redeemer was at table in the house of the Pharisee. She did not so
    much as think of the disgrace to which she exposed herself by
    appearing before a numerous and honorable assembly, of the
    reproaches and disdain she was to expect from the Pharisee, or the
    fear of moving Christ himself to indignation by an unseasonable
    importunate address. One moment’s delay in seeking her physician
    seemed too much, because her heart was now wounded with divine
    love. Sinners who, in returning to God, think too nicely that they
    have temporal interests to provide for, friends to please, and
    opportunities to wait for, are far from the dispositions of this
    happy penitent. She found mercy because she sought it before all
    things. Had she dallied with grace, it would have been justly
    withdrawn; had she been for compounding with her passions, they
    would have again enslaved her more strongly than ever. She found
    all difficulties vanish in a moment, because her conversion was
    sincere and perfect; by one steady resolution the work is done.
    What further deliberation can one that has sinned require than
    that the gate of mercy is yet open to him? Let him at all rates
    make haste to find it, though for this he should sacrifice every
    thing else. So insupportable to this holy penitent was the stench
    of her own filth, and the load of her guilt, that she could not
    defer the remedy an hour longer to wait for a better opportunity,
    or to inquire if our Lord was at leisure to hear her; and a firm
    confidence in his boundless mercy was her encouragement, and her
    strong assurance that he would not reject her tears.</p>
  <p>
    When the prodigal son said to himself, <i>I&nbsp;will arise, and
    will go to my Father</i>, we might have asked him, says
    St.&nbsp;Peter Chrysologus, what he trusted to for his pardon?
    upon what he grounded his confidence? upon what hope or assurance
    he presumed to appear in the presence of him whom he had so
    heinously offended? His answer would have been, “This is the
    assured ground of my confidence, that he is my Father. I&nbsp;have
    forfeited all title to the name or rank of his son; but he hath
    not lost the quality or affection of a parent. I&nbsp;want no
    stranger to intercede with a father. The tender affection of his
    own breast pleads powerfully within him, and is sure to incline
    him in my favor.<a id="c22_1c"> </a>His paternal bowels are moved,
    and yearn to restore to a son by pardon that life which he
    formerly gave him by birth.”<a
      href="#fn_247"
      class="anchor">247</a>
    In like sentiments this penitent woman seeks her Almighty
    Physician, professing herself altogether undeserving and unworthy
    of mercy, and therefore alleges nothing on her side to recommend
    her to his compassion, except only that she was the work of his
    hands, though an unnatural and rebellious child, in whom that
    title was only a grievous exaggeration of her guilt; but she
    confidently appeals to his infinite goodness and mercy, and begs
    that for his own sake he will save her, in whom he still
    discovers, though frightfully disfigured, the traces of his divine
    image which his own omnipotent hand had formed, and which it is in
    his power easily to repair and perfect.</p>
  <p id="c22_1d">
    In these dispositions she bolted into the chamber where Jesus was
    at dinner with the Pharisee, and, regardless of what others
    thought or said of her past life or of her present boldness,<a
      href="#fn_248"
      class="anchor">248</a>
    she made up to her Redeemer and Physician. She durst not appear
    before his face, and therefore went behind him; and the nearer she
    approached his sacred person streams gushed more abundantly from
    her eyes. She reflected how basely she had defiled and sought to
    destroy her own soul, and how impiously she had robbed Christ of
    many other souls whilst he was come from heaven, and was ready to
    sacrifice himself on the cross for her and them; and at this and
    other like considerations she was not able to moderate her grief.
    The inward confusion she felt at the sight of her sins and
    baseness made her despise all the confusion which she could
    receive before men, or rather rejoice in it to meet that contempt
    which she acknowledged herself most justly to deserve from all
    creatures. Attentive only on Christ, from whom she sought her
    health and salvation, standing at his feet, she watered them with
    her tears, wiped them with her hair, most respectfully kissed
    them, and anointed them with rich perfumes and sweet-scented
    essences which she had brought in an alabaster box. She now
    defaces or consecrates to penance whatever had formerly been an
    instrument of sin; her eyes, which had been full of dangerous
    charms, are now converted into fountains of tears to cleanse the
    stains of her soul; and her hair, once dressed in tresses and
    curls to ensnare souls, now hangs loose and dishevelled, and
    serves for a towel to wipe our Lord’s feet, which she kisses with
    her lips, and scents with her perfumes, formerly the incentives of
    vice. The penitent must consecrate his riches to Christ in the
    poor which are his feet; must employ his eyes in tears, and his
    lips in supplications for mercy, and must make all that serve to
    charity and mortification which before served self-love. These
    exterior offerings must be accompanied with the interior sacrifice
    of the heart, by humble confidence in the divine mercy, by lively
    faith and ardent love, with which the soul of a sinner approaches
    to Jesus, and is reconciled to him. Our holy penitent prepared as
    it were an altar at the feet of our Lord, on which she offered to
    him the true sacrifice of a contrite and humble heart. There
    losing the use of her speech whilst grief intercepted her words,
    she spoke only by her tears; but before Him to whom the secrets of
    her heart were open, these sighs, and this silence itself, was a
    louder cry than that of any words could have been. Thus she
    earnestly begged of God’s pure mercy, that pardon which she
    confessed herself most unworthy to obtain.</p>
  <p>
    Jesus, who had himself inspired her with these dispositions, cast
    on her a favorable eye of mercy. He was come to the Pharisee’s
    banquet exulting with holy joy, which sprung from his
    foreknowledge of the conversion of this soul; the mainspring of
    all he did and suffered on earth being that insatiable thirst for
    the salvation of sinners which brought him from heaven, and which
    was not to be satisfied but by his sufferings on the cross, and by
    the last drop of his blood poured out for them upon it. In these
    sentiments he had testified that it was his delight to converse
    with sinners, out of compassion for their miseries, being desirous
    to draw them out of that gulf into which they had blindly plunged
    themselves. This he expressed by many moving parables, especially
    that of the prodigal son, where he paints his mercy in the
    strongest coloring by the manner in which he represents the good
    old father receiving him upon his return. From the time of his
    going astray the tender parent never allowed himself any respite
    in his tears, inquiries, and search: at length, from an eminence
    in which he looked about on every side, still hoping he should one
    day see him return, he descried him at a distance. He saw only a
    disfigured, languishing, and frightful spectre; the wretched
    remains of a debauchee and rake worn out by riots and revellings:
    his features horrid and defaced, his body resembling a walking
    skeleton, but half covered with a few filthy rags. Yet, under this
    disguise, his eye, directed by love, discovered him at a great
    distance, and before any other could see him, knew that it was his
    son. Far from being disgusted at such a spectacle, he ran to meet
    him, affection giving vigor to his enfeebled age. He remembered no
    longer his past behavior, but rushing to his embraces, kissed him,
    and bathed his head and face with floods of tears which joy drew
    from his eyes, and which he mingled with the tears of sincere
    grief and affection which the penitent son abundantly poured
    forth. The good father wiped them off his face, prevented his
    confusion, restored him to his former rank, called for, and gave
    him the best robe; a ring upon his finger (a symbol of dignity),
    and shoes on his feet. He, moreover, ordered a fatted calf to be
    forthwith killed, and gave a splendid entertainment with music,
    inviting all to rejoice with him and make merry, because his son
    whom he lamented as dead was come to life again, and he that had
    been lost was found. If the birth of this son, when he was first
    brought to life, had been to him a subject of great joy, how much
    more reason had he to rejoice seeing him now restored by a second
    birth, so much the more joyful, as it wiped away his tears, and
    changed his grievous sorrow into comfort? Thus doth our loving God
    and Redeemer receive the penitent sinner; thus is there joy in
    heaven upon one sinner that doth penance. The Holy Ghost clothes
    him with the robe of sanctifying grace, puts a ring on his hand,
    the emblem of his divine gifts, and gives shoes to his feet, that
    is, fortifies him with strength to tread on the venomous aspick
    and basilisk, and to trample upon the raging lion and dragon.</p>
  <p>
    The Pharisee who had invited Jesus to his table, was shocked to
    see an infamous sinner well known in that city, admitted by our
    Lord to stand at his feet, and secretly said within himself that
    He could not be a prophet, or know that she was a scandalous
    person. To inculcate our strict obligation of shunning bad
    company, God commanded all intimacy with public sinners to be
    avoided, lest the sound should be infected by the contagion of
    their vices. The haughty Pharisees construed this law according to
    the false maxims of their pride, as if it were a part of virtue to
    despise sinners, and as if that respect and charity which we owe
    to all men, were not due to such; but the humble man, whilst he
    shuns the snare of wicked company, places himself below the worst
    of sinners, as the most ungrateful of all creatures; discharges
    all offices of charity, and spares neither tears nor pains to
    reclaim those that are gone astray. The contempt of any one is
    always the height of pride, which degrades a man in the sight of
    God beneath that sinner whom he undervalues. This was the case of
    the Pharisee; and such was the disorder of his pride that it
    betrayed him into a rash judgment by which he condemned a penitent
    who was then a saint; and, arraigning the goodness and mercy of
    God, blasphemously censured the sanctity of our Redeemer. Nothing
    is more wonderful in the conduct of the Son of God on earth, than
    the patience and meekness with which he bore the contradictions,
    murmurings, and blasphemies of men in most unjustly condemning his
    charity itself. We cannot form any idea unless we have experienced
    it, what force such injurious treatment has to make men abandon
    the good which they have begun, and cease bestowing favors on
    those that murmur against them. Christ has encouraged us by his
    example to this heroic practice of virtue, teaching us that the
    most effectual means of confounding slanderers is to instruct them
    by silence, meekness, perseverance in good works, and a constant
    return of sincere kind offices; he shows how we must still
    persevere steadfastly to regulate our intentions and actions
    according to the maxims of piety, and give ourselves no trouble
    about what men will say of us.</p>
  <p>
    Christ sought indirectly by a parable, to cure the pride and rash
    judgment of this Pharisee, and convince him that she to whom much
    had been forgiven, then loved God the more; consequently was more
    acceptable to him. Some interpreters understand his words, that
    much was forgiven this penitent, because her love and sorrow were
    great and sincere; others take the meaning to be, that gratitude
    would make her after this mercy more fervent in love. Each
    interpretation is undoubtedly true; but, as A.&nbsp;Lapide shows,
    the first seems most agreeable to the context. The conversion of
    sinners is usually begun by motives of fear, but is always
    perfected by those of love; and the fervor of their love will be
    the measure of the grace which they will receive. By the love of
    vanity the soul falls from Christ; and by his divine love she
    returns to him. How fervent was this love in our devout penitent!
    By it she is become at once insensible of the reproaches and
    judgment of men; she defers not her sacrifice a single moment, and
    allows not herself the least mitigation in it; she cuts off all
    her engagements, extirpating them to the very root both in her
    heart and actions; she renounces for ever all dangerous occasions
    of her disorders. With what courage and resolution does she
    embrace all the most heroic practices of penance? confessing
    publicly her crimes: looking upon the utmost humiliation as her
    due and her gain, and as falling far short of what she deserves;
    chastising sin in herself without mercy, in order to excite the
    divine compassion; making the number and enormity of her sins the
    measure of her penance, or rather desiring to set no bounds to it,
    as the malice of her offences went beyond all bounds; and devoting
    the remainder of her life to tears, prayer, and every exercise of
    virtue and divine love. She is the first to confess Jesus Christ
    publicly before men, and in the presence of his enemies. By these
    dispositions she deserved that her Lord should take upon him her
    defence, and declare himself her protector. Happy are those
    sinners who by the sincerity and fervor of their repentance will
    have at the last day their Judge, Redeemer, and God, for their
    advocate and patron! The first and most important grace which the
    Church teaches us in her litany most earnestly to ask of God is,
    that He vouchsafe, in his mercy, to bring us to this true
    penance.</p>
  <p>
    Mercy is the property and the favorite attribute of our divine
    Redeemer; and tinder is not so soon kindled by fire when applied
    to it, as the divine mercy blots out all sin when it is implored
    with a heart full of confusion and truly penitent. Hence Christ
    assured this humble sinner that her offences were cancelled, and
    that her lively faith, animated by ardent charity, which drew from
    her eyes tears of repentance, had saved her; and he insured to her
    that solid and happy peace which is the fruit of such a
    repentance. The pious cardinal Berulle admires the happy
    intercourse between the heart of this holy penitent and that of
    Jesus; the first employed in the most perfect sentiments of
    compunction, love, and entire sacrifice; the second, in the tender
    motions of mercy, love, and goodness: the penitent offers floods
    of tears; these Jesus repays with treasures of graces and mercy,
    by which he makes her soul a heaven on earth, as bright and pure
    as the angels, and the throne of the whole blessed Trinity. The
    hearts of the penitent and of Jesus are two sources which
    perpetually answer each other; the more the penitent pours forth
    her heart in contrition, the more abundantly does Jesus in return
    bestow on her his infinite graces. It is at the feet of Jesus that
    these wonders are wrought; witness this example, and that of the
    sister of Lazarus, in the house of Simon the Leper in Bethania. It
    is good for us to make this our dwelling in spirit. The adorable
    feet of Jesus so often wearied in seeking sinners, and at last
    bored on the cross for their salvation, are the source of all
    blessings. Here this true penitent consecrates to him her heart,
    her mind, her actions, her perfumes, all she is or has; and here
    he cleanses her soul, and kindles in her his love, which the rebel
    angel lost in heaven. All his attention is taken up on her, he
    entertains her alone, forgetting the master of the feast, and
    others that were seated with him at table. He even gave the
    Pharisee sensible proofs how much her fervor and penance surpassed
    in the sight of God his pretended justice and charity, though it
    were presumed real. Perseverance in this fervor completed her
    happiness. Gratitude to God for so great a mercy, and so
    distinguished a grace, was to her a fresh spur to advance every
    day in this love with greater ardor and fidelity. Thus the greater
    the debts were which had been forgiven her, the more earnestly she
    strove with all her powers to love him who vouchsafed to accept
    her humble sacrifice. This same motive of gratitude ought to have
    no less weight with those who, by God’s singular grace, have
    always preserved their innocence; for, whether God shows mercy by
    pardoning sins or by preventing them in us, we are totally
    indebted to Him for the grace which we receive.<a id="c22_1e">
    </a>Upon this great principle, St.&nbsp;Austin addresses the
    Pharisee who despised our holy penitent, in the following words:<a
      href="#fn_249"
      class="anchor">249</a>
    “O&nbsp;Pharisee! to say you are less indebted to the divine
    mercy, because less was forgiven you, is a capital ingratitude and
    pride. For by whom were you preserved from those crimes which you
    did not commit? One who hath sinned much, stands indebted for the
    gracious pardon of exceeding great debts. Another who hath sinned
    less, owes to God the benefit, that he hath not defiled himself
    with grievous sins. You have not fallen into adultery; but God
    saith to you, it is owing to me who governed and protected you. If
    no tempter ever enticed you, this was the effect of my special
    care and providence in your favor. If you escaped the occasions of
    dangers from time and place, this likewise was ordained by me.
    Perhaps a temptation and an opportunity of sinning occurred; yet
    I&nbsp;withheld you by wholesome fear, that you did not consent to
    the evil. You are indebted to me for your preservation from all
    the crimes which you did not commit; for there is no sin that one
    committeth, which another person might not commit if he were not
    preserved by him who made man.” We cannot sufficiently admire and
    praise the excess of the divine goodness towards men who were born
    children of wrath, and vessels of weakness and corruption.
    Wonderful is his mercy in those whom he preserves from the
    contagion of vice and mortal sin; but its influence appears with
    the greatest lustre in sinners whom by repentance it not only
    cleanses from their guilt, but exalts to the highest places in his
    favor. Of this our fervent penitent is an instance, who, after her
    conversion, surpassed others in the ardor of her charity, with
    which she gave herself up entirely to the service of her
    Redeemer.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Clement of Alexandria, St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great, and
    many other writers both ancient and modern, doubt not but this
    penitent was Mary Magdalen, of whom St.&nbsp;Luke makes first
    mention in the following chapter.<a id="c22_1f"> </a>This surname
    seems to have been given her from Magdala, a town mentioned by
    Josephus, or rather from Magdalum, both situated in Galilee.<a
      href="#fn_250"
      class="anchor">250</a>
    She was by extraction a Galilæan, and is reckoned among the devout
    women who followed Christ from Galilee.<a id="c22_1g">
    </a>St.&nbsp;Luke, after speaking of the conversion of her that
    had been a sinner, says<a
      href="#fn_251"
      class="anchor">251</a>
    that certain women who had been cured of wicked spirits and
    infirmities followed Christ in his travels through Galilee, and up
    to Jerusalem, and assisted him with their substance; and our Lord
    receives such good offices from them, to give them an occasion of
    exercising a gratitude and charity with which he was well pleased.
    Among these, the evangelist names Mary Magdalen, out of whom our
    Lord had cast seven devils, Joanna the wife of Chusa Herod’s
    steward, and one Susanna. St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great, Lightfoot,
    and some others, by these seven devils understand seven capital
    vices of which Magdalen was cured by her conversion; but Maldonat,
    Grotius, and others doubt not but she had been literally possessed
    by seven evil spirits, by whom she might be agitated at intervals,
    and which were cast forth at her conversion.<a id="c22_1h">
    </a>Gratitude and devotion having attached her to our Divine
    Redeemer after so great a benefit, she followed him almost
    wherever he went, that she might have an opportunity of listening
    to all his sacred instructions, and of exercising her charity in
    ministering to him her substance.<a
      href="#fn_252"
      class="anchor">252</a>
    She attended him in his sacred passion, and stood under the cross
    on Mount Calvary. For her to arrive at the summit of divine love,
    it was necessary she should pass through the sharpest trials. “No
    one,” says Thomas à Kempis, “was highly rapt whose fidelity was
    not sooner or later put to the test; for he is not worthy of the
    high contemplation of God who hath not, for God’s sake, been
    exercised with some tribulation; and the trial going before is
    usually a sign of ensuing consolation.” A&nbsp;great mystery is
    contained in those words of the evangelist,—<i>There stood near
    the cross of Jesus, Mary his mother, and his mother’s sister Mary
    of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen</i>. Happy association! happy state
    and situation near Jesus on his cross! cries out the devout
    cardinal Berulle. This is a new order of souls which consists in
    the spirit, in the interior, and is invisible to men, but visible
    and glorious to the eyes of God and the angels. An order of souls
    crucified with Jesus, and through Jesus, which takes its birth
    from his cross. The order, at the same time, both of the cross and
    of heaven; the order and school of love by the martyrdom of the
    heart; which by learning to die to the world and inordinate
    self-love, lives to God and his pure love. This happiness we
    attain to, by being united in spirit to Jesus crucified, as
    Magdalen was at the foot of his cross. She suffered by love what
    he suffered in his body by the hands of the Jews. The same cross
    crucified Jesus and Magdalen in him and with him. The thorns
    pierced her heart with his head, and her soul was bathed in all
    his sorrows; but the crucifixion was in both a martyrdom of love;
    and that love which triumphed over Jesus by making him die on the
    cross, crucified her heart to all inordinate love of creatures,
    thenceforward to reign and triumph alone in all her affections, so
    that she could say in a twofold sense; “My love is crucified.”
    Mary Magdalen forsook not her Redeemer after his death; but
    remained by his sacred body, was present at its interment, left it
    only to obey the law of observing the festival, and having rested
    on the sabbath from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, as
    soon as the festival was over went to buy spices in order to
    embalm our Lord’s body.<a id="c22_1i"> </a>Having made all things
    ready, in company with other devout women, she set out very early
    the next morning with the spices, before it was light, and arrived
    at the sepulchre just when the sun was risen.<a
      href="#fn_253"
      class="anchor">253</a>
    As they went they were anxious how they should get the heavy stone
    which shut up the door of the monument, taken away; but upon their
    arrival found it removed to their hands. God never fails to be
    with his servants in what they undertake for his honor; and the
    difficulties, whether real or imaginary, with the apprehension of
    which the devil attempts to discourage them, are banished by
    confidence and resolution, and vanish as shadows in the execution.
    The pious women looked into the sepulchre, and finding the body
    not there, Mary Magdalen ran to inform Peter and the other
    disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken away
    the Lord out of the sepulchre, and I&nbsp;know not where they have
    laid him.” SS.&nbsp;Peter and John, the two most fervent in love
    among the apostles, ran immediately to the sepulchre, and were
    there assured by the holy women who were at the door of the
    monument, that going in they had seen two angels clad in white
    shining apparel, and that one of them who sat at the right hand of
    the place where the body had lain, bid them not to fear, but to
    acquaint the apostles that Jesus was risen, showing them at the
    same time the place where his body had been laid. Peter and John
    having narrowly viewed the sepulchre, doubted no longer of what
    was told them, and in great astonishment returned to Jerusalem to
    the other disciples. Mary Magdalen, who had brought them to the
    sepulchre of her Lord, made the throne of divine love, would not
    return with them, or be drawn from the sacred place where the true
    ark of the testament, the body of her Redeemer, had rested three
    days, and continued at the monument bemoaning herself for not
    being able to see her Redeemer, either dead or alive. Not being
    able to assuage the violence of her grief and of her desire to see
    her Lord, she stood weeping without the door of the sepulchre. The
    entrance being low and narrow she stooped down to look into it
    again and again, and beheld the two angels in white, one of them
    sitting at the place where Jesus’s head lay, and the other at the
    feet, who thus accosted her, “Woman, why weepest thou?” She
    replied, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I&nbsp;know
    not where they have laid him.” Neither the surprise of this
    apparition nor the brightness and glory of these heavenly
    messengers could touch her heart, or divert her thoughts from him
    whom she loved, and whom alone she sought, and we suffer so many
    foolish objects to distract us, and carry away our affections. In
    her answer to the angels she called him <i>My Lord</i>, to express
    the share which by love she had in him, and her title to him as
    her God, Lord, and Redeemer. Afterward to the apostles she calls
    him <i>The Lord</i>, to excite them to duty and love to the common
    Lord of all creatures. But why did not these angels inform her
    that he whom she so earnestly sought was risen in glory?
    Doubtless, because the Lord of angels would reserve it to himself
    to give her that comfort. Blessed be thy name for ever,
    O&nbsp;adorable Jesus, who so tenderly wipest away the tears of
    thy servants with thy own hand, and sweet voice, and convertest
    their sorrow into transports of inexpressible joy. Jesus first
    manifested himself to the Magdalen in disguise to make a trial
    himself of her love; but his tenderness could not suffer a delay,
    and he soon discovered himself openly to her; for, as soon as she
    had returned the answer above mentioned to the angels, she turned
    about, and saw Jesus himself standing by her, but took him for the
    gardener. He asked her why she wept, and whom she sought. She said
    to him, “Sir, if thou hast taken him hence tell me where thou hast
    laid him, and I&nbsp;will take him away.” According to the remark
    of St.&nbsp;Bernard and St.&nbsp;Thomas of Villa Nova, love made
    her not to name him, because being full of Him alone, she imagined
    every body else must be so too, and that this stranger must
    understand of whom she spoke. Love also made her forget her own
    weakness, and think herself able to carry a heavy corpse, provided
    she could be so happy any way as to serve her beloved; for to
    ardent love nothing seems impossible or difficult. Jesus,
    infinitely pleased with her earnestness and love, manifested
    himself to her, saying with his sweet and amiable voice;
    <i>Mary!</i> He at first mentioned her tears, and the object which
    she so earnestly sought, to excite her love. All this while she
    knew him not, though he was present, and conversing with her,
    because these words carried not with them the ray of light to
    discover him; but her name was no sooner pronounced by him, but
    his voice excited in her a rapture of light and love, and gave her
    the most sublime and full knowledge, and the sweetest enjoyment of
    the most desirable of objects, of him risen in glory who was the
    life of the world, and her life. Hearing him sweetly call her by
    her name, and thus knowing him, she turning said, <i>Rabboni</i>,
    that is, Master. And casting herself at his feet in transports of
    devotion she would have embraced them. But Jesus said to her, “Do
    not touch me; for I&nbsp;have not yet ascended to my Father; but
    go to my brethren, and tell them, that I&nbsp;ascend to my Father
    and your Father, to my God and your God.” That is, my Father by
    nature, yours by grace, says St.&nbsp;Austin. He bade her make
    haste to carry his message to his beloved disciples for their
    speedy comfort, and not lose time in giving demonstrations of her
    reverence and love.<a id="c22_1j"> </a>St.&nbsp;Leo explains these
    words of our Lord as follows,<a
      href="#fn_254"
      class="anchor">254</a>
    “It is not a time to demonstrate your affection for me in such a
    manner as if I&nbsp;were in a mortal state; I&nbsp;am with you but
    for a short time, to strengthen your faith. When I&nbsp;shall have
    ascended to my Father, then you shall again possess me for
    eternity.” Thus Mary Magdalen, out of whom Jesus had cast seven
    evil spirits, was the first that saw Him after his rising from the
    dead. This pre-eminence of grace, this distinguishing favor and
    love of Jesus was the recompense of her ardent love, by which she
    attended last his body in the sepulchre, from which she was only
    drawn by the duty of the Sabbath; and she was the first who
    returned thither: she sought him dead, and found him living.<a
    id="c22_1k"> </a>In obedience to his commands she immediately
    departed to acquaint the apostles with the joyful message.<a
      href="#fn_255"
      class="anchor">255</a>
    Jesus, who suffered her so long at his feet to satisfy her ardent
    love and compunction when he received her to mercy, here allows
    her, after her long search, scarce to remain a few moments in the
    state of enjoyment; but he separates himself from her to return
    into the secret of inaccessible light, invisible to mortal eye.
    Why does not he who is Life itself allow her to live in his happy
    presence? Why does not he allow her at least as many hours of
    enjoyment as she had spent in her search of him? But this
    separation itself is an effect of his greatest love, this life
    being a state of action, of conflict, and of trials for the
    exercise of virtue; and Magdalen in this separation itself which
    was from him, by his appointment, and for her greater advancement
    in his love, found by obedience, zeal, and resignation to his
    will, her comfort, life, and great increase of his love and all
    graces. The other devout women who had seen the angels at the
    sepulchre, in their return to Jerusalem, were also favored with an
    apparition of our Lord.<a id="c22_1l"> </a>He having met and
    saluted them, they prostrated themselves at his feet, and embraced

    It is an ancient popular tradition of the inhabitants of Provence
    in France, that St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen, or perhaps, Mary the
    sister of Lazarus, St.&nbsp;Martha, and St.&nbsp;Lazarus, with
    some other disciples of our Lord, after his ascension, being
    expelled by the Jews, put to sea, and landed safe at Marseilles,
    of which church they were the founders, St.&nbsp;Lazarus being
    made the first bishop of that city.<a
      href="#fn_259"
      class="anchor">259</a>
    The relics of these saints were discovered in Provence in the
    thirteenth century, those of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen at a place now
    called St.&nbsp;Maximin’s, those of St.&nbsp;Martha at Tarascon
    upon the Rhone, and others in St.&nbsp;Victor’s at Marseilles.
    They were authentically proved genuine by many monuments found
    with them in these several places. Charles&nbsp;I., king of Naples
    and brother of St.&nbsp;Louis, was at that time sovereign count of
    Provence; but he being then in Naples engaged in war with the
    house of Arragon, his son Charles of Anjou, prince of Salerno,
    governed Provence. This prince was beaten at sea by the fleet of
    the king of Arragon in&nbsp;1284, and taken prisoner; and though
    his father died the year following, he could not recover his
    liberty before the year&nbsp;1288. He ascribed his deliverance to
    the intercession of our saint, the discovery of whose relics had
    excited his devotion to her; he had already founded the church of
    St.&nbsp;Maximin’s upon the spot where they were discovered, and
    assisted at the solemn translation of them in&nbsp;1279. He
    committed this royal foundation to the Dominican friars, and the
    prior, who is nominated by the king, is exempt from the ordinary
    jurisdiction both of the archbishop of Aix, and of the immediate
    superiors of his Order. The chief part of the relics of this saint
    was translated from the subterraneous chapel in the middle of this
    church, and being put in a porphyry urn, the present of pope
    Urban&nbsp;VIII. was placed over the high altar. King
    Louis&nbsp;XIV., and the principal noblemen of his court, were
    present at this translation, which was performed with great pomp
    in 1660. The saint’s head, with many other relics, remains in the
    subterraneous chapel; it is set in a gold case enchased with large
    diamonds, and surmounted with the royal crown of Charles&nbsp;II.
    styled king of Sicily or Naples. Before it is a curious statue of
    queen Anne of Brittany, on her knees, made of enamelled gold.
    Three leagues from St.&nbsp;Maximin’s, towards Marseilles, is a
    famous solitary convent of Dominicans, situated on a very high
    rock, encompassed on every side with wild deserts and mountains.
    It is called La Ste.&nbsp;Baume; which in the Provençal language
    signifies Holy Cave. It was anciently a celebrated hermitage, and
    is a place now resorted to by pilgrims, out of devotion to this
    glorious saint. Both Latins and Greeks keep the festival of
    St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen on the 22d of July; it is in some places a
    holiday of precept, and was such formerly in England, as appears
    from the council of Oxford in&nbsp;1222.</p>

    The pious cardinal Berulle was most tenderly devoted to this great
    saint, whom he called his principal patroness; and nothing can be
    more affecting in sentiments of compunction and divine love than
    the discourses which he has left us in her honor.<a
      href="#fn_260"
      class="anchor">260</a>
    She is the excellent model of penitents. If we have sinned, why do
    not we by her example speedily lay hold of the sovereign remedy of
    penance? If violent temptations and terrible enemies seem to stand
    in our way, if the world allures us, if the devil fights fiercely
    against us, and unbridled passions are rebellious and clamorous,
    other penitents have courageously surmounted greater obstacles
    than we can meet with. God incites us no less than he did them,
    and he is no less ready to fight in us and for us. Jesus holds out
    the crown to encourage us, and has already prepared the banquet of
    spiritual joy and sweetness for us at our return. If we arise in
    earnest he will come, and will make his solemn supper in our soul;
    and there will be exultation and a voice resounding praise through
    the whole heavenly court; but we must never think our penance
    accomplished, must never put a stop to our tears so long as we
    remember that we have sinned: God prolongs our life that we may
    continue to weep for our ingratitude in having offended him. If
    our conversion be sincere, to make amends for past losses and
    offences, we must consecrate to the divine service with the utmost
    fervor all our time, and all that we are to do. The Magdalen,
    after Jesus Christ had rendered himself master of her soul, had
    neither heart nor liberty but to give herself entirely to her
    deliverer.</p>

    SAINT VANDRILLE OR WANDRE&nbsp;GISILUS.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    ABBOT OF FONTENELLES IN NORMANDY.</p>
  <p>
    He was nearly related to Pepin of Landen and Erchinoald, the two
    first lords in the kingdom of Austrasia; and in his youth was made
    count of the palace under Dagobert&nbsp;I. He was humble on the
    highest pinnacle of honors, and mortified amidst pleasures. To
    retrieve himself from the dissipation and other ill effects, of
    which hurry and much conversation with the world are dangerous
    occasions, he frequently retired into his closet, and there
    conversed much with God by devout prayer, and with himself by
    serious consideration on his own duties, condition, and spiritual
    miseries. In compliance with the will of his parents he took to
    wife a virtuous and noble lady; but, on the very day of his
    marriage, obtained her consent that they should both consecrate
    their virginity to God; which they did by a mutual vow on the same
    day. Vandrille in&nbsp;629 took the monastic habit at Montfaucon
    in Champagne, an abbey then lately founded by St.&nbsp;Baudri. He
    afterward built a monastery upon his own estate, called Elisang.
    In order to perfect himself in the most approved rules and
    exercises of an ascetic or monastic life, he took a journey to
    Bobio and to Rome. After his return into France he spent ten years
    in the monastery of Romans, on the Isere. After which term, with
    the blessing of his abbot, he repaired to St.&nbsp;Oüen,
    archbishop of Rouen, by whom he was some time after ordained
    priest. In 648 the saint founded the famous monastery of
    Fontenelles, five leagues below Rouen, in the territory of Caux,
    in which he in a short time saw himself at the head of three
    hundred monks. His life was always most austere; he slept little,
    was clad in sackcloth, and was most scrupulously exact in all the
    exercises of the monastic rule, in which, he was well assured, the
    sanctification of his state consisted. He went to receive the
    recompense of his labors on the 22d of July in&nbsp;666, being
    ninety-six years old. He was buried in the church of
    St.&nbsp;Paul, now in ruins: his body was translated by
    St.&nbsp;Bainus into that of St.&nbsp;Peter’s, still standing; and
    in 944 to Ghent. It was lost in the persecution of the Calvinists
    in&nbsp;1578; but an arm had been restored to Fontenelles, and the
    other arm been given to the abbey of Brone; where these relics are
    still preserved. See his two lives of the same age in Mabillon,

    SAINT JOSEPH OF&nbsp;PALESTINE.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    COMMONLY CALLED COUNT JOSEPH.</p>
  <p>
    The Jews, after the destruction of Jerusalem, erected two
    academies, the one at Babylon, the other at Tiberias, a city on
    the lake of Genesareth, rebuilt by Herod, in honor of the emperor
    Tiberias. Both these schools flourished till the Saracen empire
    overran those countries. That of Tiberias produced the Massoretes
    or Massoretic doctors, so famous for the invention of the vowel
    points in the Hebrew tongue, and their care in preserving the
    genuine text of the holy bible. Though the Jews then retained no
    sort of jurisdiction or form of government, yet they chose one
    among their chief doctors to whom they gave the title of patriarch
    or prince of the captivity. The most celebrated person who ever
    bore this honor among them was Hillel, whose name is still in
    great veneration with the Jews, and who was their most learned
    oracle, and the principal founder and ornament of their academy at
    Tiberias. This Hillel, a few days before his death, sent for a
    Christian bishop in the neighborhood under the character of a
    physician, who ordered a bath to be prepared in his chamber, as if
    it had been for his health, and baptized him in it. Hillel
    received the divine mysteries, and died.</p>
  <p>
    Joseph, one of his assistants, called Apostoli, whose life we are
    writing, was witness to this secret transaction, and having always
    been the confident of Hillel, had the care of his son Judas who
    succeeded him in the dignity of patriarch of the Jews. He found
    the holy gospels in Hillel’s treasure, and read them with
    incredible pleasure. The young patriarch fell into evil courses,
    and employed magical arts to seduce a Christian woman; but the
    sign of the cross made his charms of no effect. Joseph was
    surprised to hear this prodigy. He seemed in a dream one night to
    see Christ, and to hear from his mouth these words, “I&nbsp;am
    Jesus whom thy fathers crucified; believe in me.” He relished our
    holy faith more than ever, and going into Cilicia to collect the
    tenths for the patriarch, he borrowed again the holy gospels. The
    Jews, already dissatisfied with his conduct, finding him with this
    holy book, dragged him to their synagogue, and cruelly scourged
    him. They were preparing worse treatment for him when the bishop
    rescued him out of their hands. Joseph having already begun to
    suffer for Christ, was soon disposed to receive baptism.</p>
  <p>
    Constantine the Great became master of the East in&nbsp;323. He
    gave Joseph the title and rank of count, with authority to build
    churches over Palestine, wherever he should judge proper. Joseph
    began to raise one at Tiberias. The Jews employed many artifices
    to hinder the work, and stopped his lime-kilns from burning by
    enchantments, but he, making the sign of the cross upon a vessel
    of water, and invoking the name of Jesus, poured it on the kilns,
    and the fire instantly burst forth and burned with great activity.
    Count Joseph showed no less zeal against the Arians than against
    the Jews, and both conspired together to persecute him; but he was
    protected by his dignity of count, which gave him a superior
    command and authority. Joseph, however, when the emperor
    Constantius persecuted the orthodox prelates, retired from
    Tiberias to the neighboring city Scythopolis, where, in&nbsp;355,
    he lodged St.&nbsp;Eusebius of Vercelli, banished by the Arians.
    His was the only Catholic house in that town. He harbored many
    other illustrious servants of God,<a id="c22_3a"> </a>and among
    the rest St.&nbsp;Epiphanius, who had from his own mouth the
    particulars here related. Joseph was then seventy years of age. He
    died soon after, about the year&nbsp;356. The Greeks and Latins
    both mention his name in their martyrologies. See

    ST.&nbsp;MENEVE, ABBOT.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born in Anjou of a family allied to the emperor
    Charlemagne. From his infancy it was his only ambition to serve
    Christ with his whole heart. When he was of an age to be settled
    in the world, his parents obliged him to accept a ring sent him by
    a great lord of the country named Baronte, as a token that he
    would marry his daughter; but to prevent this engagement, he fled
    into Auvergne, and there received the monastic habit at the hands
    of St.&nbsp;Chaffre or Theofrede, who was then œconome of the
    monastery of Carmery or Cormeri, so called from its founder
    Carmen, duke of that country, since called St.&nbsp;Theofrede’s or
    Chaffre’s monastery in Auvergne, four leagues from Puy in Velay,
    whom he had met at Menat, and followed to this abbey. Here he
    lived seven years under the holy abbot Eudo; then returned to
    Menat seven leagues from Clermont; this monastery he built in such
    a manner as to have borne the name of its founder. He governed it
    for many years with great sanctity, and died in&nbsp;720. He is
    honored with singular veneration in Auvergne and Anjou, and
    mentioned by Usuard on the 22d of July. See Mabillon, Sec.&nbsp;3,

    SAINT APOLLINARIS, MARTYR.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    BISHOP OF RAVENNA.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    See Pinius in the Acts of the Saints, Julij, t.&nbsp;5,
    p.&nbsp;329, and Farlat, Illyrici Sacra, t.&nbsp;1,
    p.&nbsp;259.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Apollinaris was the first bishop of Ravenna. Bede, in his
    true Martyrology, says that he sat twenty years, and was crowned
    with martyrdom in the reign of Vespasian. His acts say that he was
    a disciple of St.&nbsp;Peter, and made by him bishop of Ravenna.
    Though their authority deserves little regard, this circumstance
    must be allowed, being agreeable to the time, and supported by
    other authorities.<a id="c23_1a"> </a>St.&nbsp;Peter Chrysologus,
    the most illustrious among his successors, has left us a sermon in
    honor of our saint,<a
      href="#fn_261"
      class="anchor">261</a>
    in which he often styles him a martyr; but adds, that though he
    frequently spilt portions of his blood for the faith, and ardently
    desired to lay down his life for Christ, yet God preserved him a
    long time to his Church, and did not suffer the persecutors to
    take away his life. So he seems to have only been a martyr by the
    torments he endured for Christ, which he survived at least some
    days. His body lay first at Classis, four miles from Ravenna,
    still a kind of suburb to that city, and its sea-port, till it was
    choked up by the sands.<a id="c23_1b"> </a>In the year&nbsp;549
    his relics were removed into a more secret vault in the same
    church, as an inscription still extant there testifies. See
    Mabillon.<a
      href="#fn_262"
      class="anchor">262</a>
    St.&nbsp;Fortunatus exhorted his friends to make pilgrimages to
    his tomb, and St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great ordered parties in
    doubtful suits at law to be sworn before it. Pope Honorius built a
    church under his name in Rome about the year&nbsp;630. It occurs
    in all Martyrologies, and the high veneration which the Church
    paid early to his memory is a sufficient testimony of his eminent
    sanctity and apostolic spirit.</p>
  <p>
    The virtue of the saints was true and heroic, because humble, and
    proof against all trials. That of the heathen philosophers was
    lame, and generally false and counterfeit, whence Tertullian calls
    the latter, Traders in fame.<a id="c23_1c"> </a>“Where is now the
    similitude,” says he, “between a philosopher and a Christian? a
    disciple of Greece and of heaven? a trader in fame, and a saver of
    souls?<a
      href="#fn_263"
      class="anchor">263</a>
    between a man of words, and a man of works?”<a id="c23_1d">
    </a>And St.&nbsp;Jerom writes, “A philosopher is an animal of
    fame, one who basely drudges for the breath of the people.”<a
      href="#fn_264"
      class="anchor">264</a>
    Lactantius severely rallies Cicero, because, though he was very
    sensible of the vanity of the worship then established, yet he
    would not have that truth told the people for fear of unhinging
    the religion of the state. “Now what is to be done with a man,”
    says our Christian philosopher, “who knows himself in an error,
    yet wilfully dashes upon a rock, that the people may do so too?
    who makes no use of his wisdom for the regulation of his life, but
    entangles himself to ensnare others, whom, as the wiser person, he
    was obliged to rescue from error? But O&nbsp;Cicero, if you have
    any regard for virtue, attempt rather to deliver the people out of
    ignorance. It is a noble enterprise, and worthy all your powers of
    eloquence. Never fear but your oratory will hold out in so good a
    cause, which never failed you in the defence of so many bad ones.
    But Socrates’s prison is the thing you dread; and therefore truth
    must want a patron; but certainly, as a wise man, you ought to
    despise death in competition with truth; and you had fallen much
    more honorably by speaking well of truth, than for speaking ill of
    Antony;<a id="c23_1e"> </a>nor will you ever rise to that height
    of glory by your Philippics, as you would have done by laboring to
    undeceive the world, and dispute the people into their senses.”<a
      href="#fn_265"
      class="anchor">265</a>
    The philosophers did not love truth well enough to suffer for it.
    Plato dissembled, for fear of Socrates’s hemlock; but the
    Christian religion raised its professors above all considerations
    present, for the joy that was set before them.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;LIBORIUS, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;MANS,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was descended of a noble Gaulish family, and by his innocence
    and sanctity of life was recommended to the priesthood in the
    church of Mans. He loved retirement and prayer, never conversed
    with seculars but on spiritual accounts, and linked himself only
    with those among the clergy whose actions and words were such as
    might inspire him more and more with the spirit of his state. His
    distinguished learning and virtue fixed all eyes upon him, and
    in&nbsp;348 he was chosen fourth bishop of Mans. Indefatigable in
    all the functions of his charge, he prayed and fasted much, and
    was most attentive in succoring the necessities of the poor, by
    that means to draw down the blessing of God upon himself and his
    flock. He built and endowed many new churches in his diocess, and
    having governed it forty-nine years, died about the year&nbsp;397.

  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Lupus, called in French St.&nbsp;Leu, was born of a noble
    family at Toul, and being learned and eloquent, pleaded at the bar
    for some years with great reputation. He married Pimeniola, a
    virtuous sister of St.&nbsp;Hilary of Arles. After six years spent
    in holy wedlock, fired with an ardent desire of serving God with
    greater perfection, they parted by mutual consent, and made a
    mutual vow of perpetual continency. Lupus betook himself to the
    famous abbey of Lerins, then governed by St.&nbsp;Honoratus. He
    lived there a year, and added many austerities to those prescribed
    by the rule, yet always regulated his fervor by the advice of
    St.&nbsp;Honoratus. He sold great part of his estate for the
    benefit of the poor, when he renounced the world. After the first
    year, when St.&nbsp;Honoratus was made bishop of Arles, he went to
    Macon in Burgundy to dispose of an estate he had left there, in
    charitable uses. He was preparing to return to Lerins when he was
    met by the deputies of the church of Troyes, which, upon the death
    of St.&nbsp;Ursus, in&nbsp;426, had chosen him bishop, the eighth
    from St.&nbsp;Amator, founder of this see. His resistance was to
    no purpose, and he was consecrated by the prelates of the province
    of Sens. In this dignity he continued the same practices of
    humility, mortification, and as much as possible even of poverty.
    He never wore any other garments than a sackcloth and a single
    tunic, lay upon boards, and allotted every second night entire to
    watching in prayer. He often passed three days without taking any
    nourishment, and after so rigorous a fast allowed himself nothing
    but a little barley bread. Thus he lived above twenty years;
    laboring at the same time in all his pastoral functions with a
    zeal worthy an apostle.</p>
  <p>
    About the latter end of the fourth century, Pelagius, a British
    monk, and Celestius a Scot, broached their heresy in Africa,
    Italy, and the East, denying the corruption of human nature by
    original sin, and the necessity of divine grace. One Agricola, a
    disciple of these heresiarchs, had spread this poison in Britain.
    The Catholics addressed themselves to their neighbors the bishops
    of Gaul, begging their assistance to check the growing evil. An
    assembly of bishops, probably held at Arles in&nbsp;429, deputed
    St.&nbsp;Germanus of Auxerre and St.&nbsp;Lupus of Troyes, to go
    over into our island to oppose this mischief. The two holy
    pastors, burning with zeal for the glory of Christ, accepted the
    commission the more willingly as it seemed laborious and painful.
    They came over and entirely banished the heresy by their prayers,
    preaching, and miracles. St.&nbsp;Lupus, after his return, set
    himself with fresh vigor to reform the manners of his own flock.<a
    id="c24_1a"> </a>In this he displayed so great prudence and piety,
    that St.&nbsp;Sidonius Apollinaris calls him, “The father of
    fathers and bishop of bishops, the chief of the Gallican prelates,
    the rule of manners, the pillar of truth, the friend of God, and
    the intercessor to him for men.”<a
      href="#fn_266"
      class="anchor">266</a>
    He spared no pains to save one lost sheep, and his labors were
    often crowned with a success which seemed miraculous. Among other
    instances it is recorded that a certain person of his diocess,
    named Gallus, had forsaken his wife and withdrawn to Clermont.
    St.&nbsp;Lupus could not see this soul perish, but wrote to
    St.&nbsp;Sidonius, then bishop of Clermont, a strong letter so
    prudently tempered with sweetness, that Gallus by reading it was
    at once terrified and persuaded, and immediately set out to return
    to his wife. Upon which St.&nbsp;Sidonius cried out, “What is more
    wonderful than a single reprimand, which both affrights a sinner
    into compunction, and makes him love his censor!” This letter of
    St.&nbsp;Lupus and several others are lost; but we have one by
    which he congratulated Sidonius upon his promotion to his see,
    having passed from a secular prefecture or government to the
    episcopacy, which charge he shows to be laborious, difficult and
    dangerous. He strongly exhorts him, above all things, to
    humility.<a id="c24_1b"> </a>This letter was written in&nbsp;471,
    and is given us by D’Achery.<a
      href="#fn_267"

  <p>
    God at that time afflicted the western empire with grievous
    calamities, and Attila with a numberless army of Huns overran
    Gaul, calling himself “The Scourge of God,” to punish the sins of
    the people. Rheims, Cambray, Besançon, Auxerre, and Langres had
    already felt the effects of his fury, and Troyes was the next
    place threatened. The holy bishop had recourse to God in behalf of
    his people by fervent prayer, which he continued for many days,
    prostrate on the ground, fasting and weeping without intermission.
    At length, putting on his bishop’s attire, full of confidence in
    God, he went out to meet the barbarian at the head of his army.
    Attila, though an infidel, seeing him, was moved to reverence the
    man of God, who came up to him boldly, followed by his clergy in
    procession, with a cross carried before them. He spoke to the king
    first, and asked him who he was? “I am,” said Attila, “the scourge
    of God.” “Let us respect whatever comes to us from God,” replied
    the bishop; “but if you are the scourge with which heaven
    chastises us, remember you are to do nothing but what that
    almighty hand, which governs and moves you, permits.” Attila,
    struck with these words, promised the prelate to spare the city.
    Thus the saint’s prayer was a better defence than the most
    impregnable ramparts. It protected a city which had neither arms,
    nor garrison, nor walls, against an army of at least four hundred
    thousand men, which, after plundering Thrace, Illyricum, and
    Greece, crossing the Rhine, had filled with blood and desolation
    the most flourishing countries of France. Attila, turning with his
    army from Troyes, was met on the plains of Chalons by Aëtius, the
    brave Roman general, and there defeated. In his retreat he sent
    for St.&nbsp;Lupus, and caused him to accompany him as far as the
    Rhine, imagining that the presence of so great a servant of God
    would be a safeguard to himself and his army; and sending him
    back, he recommended himself to his prayers. This action of the
    good bishop was misconstrued by the Roman generals, as if he had
    favored the escape of the barbarian, and he was obliged to leave
    Troyes for two years. He spent that time in religious retirement,
    in great austerity and continual contemplation. When his charity
    and patience had at length overcome the envy and malice of men, he
    went back to his church, which he governed fifty-two years, dying
    in the year&nbsp;479. The chief part of his body is kept in a rich
    silver shrine; his skull and principal part of his head in another
    far more precious, in the figure of a bishop, formed of silver,
    adorned with jewels and diamonds said by some to be the richest in
    France. Both are in the abbatial church of regular canons of
    St.&nbsp;Austin, which bears the name of St.&nbsp;Lupus. He was
    first buried in the church of St.&nbsp;Martin in Areis, of the
    same Order, then out of the walls, though long since within them.
    Many churches in England bear his name. The family name of Sentlow
    among us is derived from St.&nbsp;Leu, as Camden remarks.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;FRANCIS SOLANO,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    This saint was born at Montilia in Andalusia to 1549, performed
    his studies in the schools of the Jesuits, and in 1569 made his
    religious profession amongst the Franciscans in the place of his
    nativity. An extraordinary humility and contempt of himself and of
    worldly vanity and applause; self-denial, obedience, meekness,
    patience, and the love of silence, recollection, and prayer mental
    and vocal, formed his character. Whole nights he frequently passed
    without sleep on the steps of the altar, before the Blessed
    Sacrament, in meditation and devout prayer, with wonderful
    interior delight and devotion. Burning with holy zeal and charity,
    and an ardent desire of the salvation of souls, after he was
    promoted to the priesthood, he divided his time between silent
    retirement and the ministry of preaching. His sermons, though
    destitute of the ornaments of studied eloquence, powerfully
    withdrew men from vice, and kindled in their breasts an ardent
    desire of virtue. The saint was appointed master of novices, first
    in the convent of Arizava, two miles from Cordova, afterward in
    that of Monte. Then he was made guardian in the province of
    Granada. His whole life, says Alvarez de Paz, may be called a holy
    uninterrupted course of zealous action, yet was at the same time a
    continued most fervent prayer, abounding with heavenly
    illuminations and consolations. A&nbsp;perfect spirit of poverty
    emptied his heart of the love of all created things, that Christ
    alone might occupy and fill it; and he rejoiced in his nakedness
    and privation of earthly goods, that he might barely use them to
    serve the necessities of nature, without suffering them to enslave
    his heart, or to find any place in his affections, which he
    reserved pure and entire for spiritual goods. Interior humility
    and self-denial perfected the disengagement of his heart, and the
    extraordinary austerities of his penitential life subjected his
    senses, and rendered the liberty which his soul enjoyed complete;
    by which he was prepared for the spirit of prayer and the pure
    love of heavenly things. Earthly comforts used with moderation,
    and as supports of our weakness, may be sanctified by a good
    intention; but whilst they bolster up our weakness, they keep it
    alive and strengthen it; and if they are sought after, or made use
    of with eagerness and attachment, immoderately or frequently, they
    strongly nourish self love and sensuality, and produce a distrust
    of the solid food of devotion and divine love.</p>
  <p>
    The mortified lives of all the saints who arrived at a familiarity
    with God in holy prayer, are but a comment upon, or sensible
    examples of, the indispensable gospel precept of dying to
    ourselves. By no other steps could St.&nbsp;Francis Solano have
    arrived at the perfection of spiritual life. A&nbsp;pestilence
    which raged at Granada afforded him an opportunity of exerting his
    heroic virtue in attending the infected; but a more noble theatre
    of action was opened to him by the mission into America, upon
    which he was sent. Peru and Tucuman were the countries in which he
    reaped the principal harvest; and the five last years of his life
    he preached chiefly at Lima, and induced the inhabitants of that
    great city, by sincere repentance, to appease the divine anger,
    which they had provoked by their sins. The reputation of his
    wonderful sanctity was enhanced by many miracles. Yet by humility
    he looked upon himself as the least among men, and he never
    appeared in public but when called abroad by zeal for the
    salvation of souls. Before his death he was purified by a
    lingering illness, and in his last moments repeated those words of
    the psalmist: <i>I&nbsp;have rejoiced in those things which have
    been said to me: We will go into the house of the Lord</i>. He
    departed this life on the 14th of June in&nbsp;1610, the
    sixty-second of his age, and fortieth of his religious profession.
    F.&nbsp;Alvarez de Paz, an eye-witness, describes the stately and
    religious pomp of his funeral, at which the viceroy of Peru and
    the archbishop of Lima assisted, with extraordinary devotion. The
    saint was beatified by Clement&nbsp;X. and canonized by
    Benedict&nbsp;XIII. in&nbsp;1726, and his principal festival was
    appointed on the 24th of July. See his life compiled by Didacus of
    Cordova; also by Alphonsus of Mondietta. See likewise the History

    PATRONS OF MUSCOVY.<a

      class="anchor">270</a></p>
  <p>
    The history of the conversion of the Russians (now called
    Muscovites) to the faith of Christ, has been perplexed by the
    mistakes of many who have treated this point of history.<a
    id="c24_3a"> </a>The learned Jesuit F.&nbsp;Antony Possevin was
    betrayed into many falsities concerning this people.<a
      href="#fn_271"
      class="anchor">271</a>
    <a id="c24_3b"> </a>And upon his authority some have pretended
    that the Muscovites received the faith from the Greek schismatics,
    and at the same time adhered to their schism; than which, nothing
    can be more notoriously false, as Henschenius and Papebrochius<a
      href="#fn_272"
      class="anchor">272</a>
    show. F.&nbsp;Stilting, another learned Bollandist, has
    demonstrated by an express dissertation,<a
      href="#fn_273"
      class="anchor">273</a>
    that the Muscovites were at first Catholics, and that even in the
    time of the Council of Florence the Catholics and schismatics in
    Russia made two equal halves. The Greek schism was formed by
    Cerularius several years after the conversion of the Russians. The
    schism indeed of Phocius was a short prelude to it.</p>
  <p>
    Cedrenus, Zonaras, and some others relate, that an army of
    Russians besieged Constantinople in the time of the emperor
    Michael&nbsp;III., when Photius held that see; and that being
    obliged to raise the siege, they obtained certain Greek priests
    from Constantinople, who instructed them in the Christian faith.
    This first mission Baronius places in&nbsp;853, Pagi in&nbsp;861;
    but this must either be understood of some tribe of Russians in
    Bohemia, where St.&nbsp;Cyril then preached; or these authors must
    have confounded together things which happened at different times;
    for the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenetta, who lived near that
    time, and could not but be acquainted with this transaction, says
    both in his life of his grandfather, Basil the Macedonian, and in
    his book, On administering the Empire, that the Russians besieged
    the city in the time of Photius, but that they were converted to
    the faith by priests sent at their request from Constantinople in
    the time of Basil the Macedonian and the patriarch
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius, whom that prince restored upon his ascending
    the throne in&nbsp;867; which also appears from Zonarus.</p>
  <p>
    The first plant of the faith in this nation was the holy queen
    Helen, called before her baptism Olga. She was wife to the duke
    Ihor or Igor, who undertook an expedition against the city of
    Constantinople, as Simeon Metaphrastes, the monk George, Cedrenus,
    Zonaras, and Curopalates relate. Having been repulsed by the
    generals of the emperors Romanus and Constantine, he was slain by
    the Dreulans in his return. His widow, Olga, with great valor and
    conduct, revenged his death, vanquished the Dreulans, and governed
    the state several years with uncommon prudence and courage.<a
    id="c24_3c"> </a>When she was almost seventy years old, she
    resigned the government to her son Suatoslas, and going to
    Constantinople, was there baptized, taking the name of Helen.<a
      href="#fn_274"
      class="anchor">274</a>
    Many place this event in&nbsp;952, which date seems most agreeable
    to the Greek historians; but Kulcinius and Stilting infer from the
    chronology of the dukes of Russia, that she seems to have been
    baptized in&nbsp;945. We are expressly assured by Constantine
    Porphyrogenetta that it happened in 946. She returned into her own
    country, and by her zealous endeavors brought many to the faith;
    but was never able to compass the conversion of her son, who was
    probably withheld by reasons of state. She died in&nbsp;970
    or&nbsp;978. Her grandson, Uladimir, who succeeded Suatoslas,
    asked by a solemn embassy, and obtained in marriage, Anne, sister
    to the two emperors Basil and his colleague and brother
    Constantine.<a id="c24_3d"> </a>Nicholas Crysoberga, the orthodox
    patriarch of Constantinople, a person always zealous in
    maintaining the communion of the see of Rome, at that prince’s
    request, sent into Muscovy one Michael with other preachers, who
    baptized Uladimir, and married him to the princess about the
    year&nbsp;988.<a
      href="#fn_275"
      class="anchor">275</a>
    This duke founded near Kiow the great monastery of the Cryptæ in
    favor of the abbot St.&nbsp;Antony, and died, according to
    Kulcinius, in 1008. His two sons SS.&nbsp;Boris and Hliba or
    Cliba, called in Latin Romanus and David, were murdered by the
    usurper Suatopelch, their impious brother, in&nbsp;1010. It was
    their zeal for the faith of Christ which gave occasion to their
    death. Jaroslas, another brother, defeated the usurper, and
    obtained the principality; his daughter Anne was married to
    Henry&nbsp;I., king of France, in&nbsp;1044, and became the
    foundress of the church of St.&nbsp;Vincent at Senlis. Romanus and
    David are honored in Muscovy on the 24th of July. Their remains
    were translated into a church which was built in their honor at
    Vislegorod in&nbsp;1072, the ceremony being performed with great
    pomp, by George the fifth archbishop of Kiow, and several other
    bishops, in presence of Izazlas, Suatoslas, and Usevolod, princes
    of Russia, and a great train of noblemen.<a id="c24_3e"> </a>The
    synod of Zamoski, in&nbsp;1720, which was approved by the
    Congregation de Propagandâ Fide, and confirmed by pope
    Benedict&nbsp;XIII., reckons among the holidays of precept which
    are kept by the Catholic Russians in Lithuania and other
    provinces, the feast of these two martyrs, celebrated on the 24th
    of July; and that of the translation of their relics on the 2d of
    May.<a
      href="#fn_276"

  <p id="c24_3f">

    any other Muscovite saints except of these two martyrs.<a
      href="#fn_277"
      class="anchor">277</a>
    But the Muscovites honor several other saints of their own
    country; several among whom flourished, and doubtless were placed
    by them in their Calendar before their schism, as Papebroke and
    Jos. Assemani observe. Such are the queen Helen or Olga, on the
    11th of July, who died, according to Kulcinius, in&nbsp;978.<a

    Antony, abbot, a native of Russia, who embraced the monastic state
    upon Mount Athos, and returning to Kiow, became the patriarch of
    that Order in his own country, and on a mountain half a mile from
    the town founded, about the year&nbsp;1020, the great Russian
    monastery of Pieczari or the Cryptæ, in which the archimandrite of
    all the Russian monks resides, and the archbishop of Kiow has an
    apartment.<a id="c24_3h"> </a>Antony died in&nbsp;1073, on the

    bodies of many saints and monks who lived above six hundred years
    ago, remain uncorrupted and fresh. Agapetus, disciple of Antony,
    at the Cryptæ, famous for miracles, honored on the 1st of June.
    Athanasius, monk at the Cryptæ, on the 2d of December; he was a

    Athos in Macedonia.<a id="c24_3i"> </a>He is honored by the Greeks
    and Muscovites on the 5th of July.<a
      href="#fn_280"

    The lives of these and several other ancient monks of this house
    were written by Polycarp, who died in&nbsp;1182. The grand duke
    Alexander, surnamed Newski, who died in&nbsp;1262, and is honored
    on the 30th of April. Sergius, an abbot, is honored by the
    Muscovites on the 25th of September. He died in&nbsp;1292, and was
    never involved in the schism, as Papebroke, Kulcinius, and Jos.
    Assemani show. This Sergius was born at Roslow, founded the
    monastery of the Holy Trinity at Rudosno (sixty Italian miles from
    Moscow), the richest and most numerous in Muscovy, in which are
    sometimes two or three hundred monks. The body of Sergius is kept
    there incorrupt, and is much visited out of devotion from Moscow,
    sometimes by the czars. These and several others who are named in
    the Muscovite Calendar with the most eminent saints of the eastern
    and western churches, lived either before or when this nation was
    not engaged in the Greek schism. But to these saints the
    Muscovites add some few who died since their separation from the
    catholic communion, as Photius, archbishop of Kiow, whose
    principal merit consisted in the obstinacy with which he
    maintained the schism. See Kulcinius, Specimen Ecclesiæ Ruthenicæ;

    SS. WULFHAD AND RUFFIN, MM.</h3>
  <p>
    They were two brothers, the sons of Wulfere, the king of Mercia,
    second brother and successor of Peada. Having been privately
    baptized by St.&nbsp;Chad, bishop of Litchfield, about the
    year&nbsp;670, they were both slain whilst they were at their
    prayers by their father’s order, who, out of political views, at
    that time favored idolatry, though he afterward did remarkable
    penance for this crime. His father Penda had persecuted the
    Christians, but his elder brother Peada had begun to establish the
    faith in his dominions. Florence of Worcester says, Wulfere was
    only baptized a little before his death, in&nbsp;675, consequently
    after this murder; but Bede testifies that he was godfather to
    Edelwalch, king of the West Saxons, almost twenty years before.
    But either he relapsed (at least so far as to be for some time
    favorable to idolatry), or this murder was contrived by some Pagan
    courtiers, without his privity, as Bradshaw relates it. The queen
    Emmelinda, mother of the two young princes, caused their bodies to
    be buried at Stone, which place took its name from a great heap of
    stones which was raised over their tomb, according to the Saxon
    custom. She afterward employed these stones in building a church
    upon the spot, which became very famous for bearing the names of
    these martyrs who were patrons of the town, and of a priory of
    regular canons there. The procurator of this house, in a journey
    to Rome, prevailed on the pope to enrol these two royal martyrs
    among the saints, and left the head of St.&nbsp;Wulfhad, which he
    had carried with him, in the church of St.&nbsp;Laurence at
    Viterbo. (Leland, Collect. t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2.) After
    this, Wulfere and his brother and successor Ethelred, abolished
    idols over all Mercia. See the acts of these royal martyrs in the
    History of Peterborough abbey, and Leland’s Itinerary, and
    Collect. t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;1. Also Cuper the Bollandist,

    JULY XXV.</h2>
  <h3 class="sthd">
    ST.&nbsp;JAMES THE GREAT, APOSTLE.</h3>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;James, the brother of St.&nbsp;John Evangelist, son of
    Zebedee and Salome and nearly related to Christ, was called the
    Great to distinguish him from the other apostle of the same name
    who was bishop of Jerusalem, and is surnamed the Less, perhaps
    because he was lower in stature, or more probably because he was
    the younger. St. James the Great seems to have been born about
    twelve years before Christ, and was many years older than his
    brother St.&nbsp;John. Salome is otherwise called Mary, and was
    sister to the Blessed Virgin, which some take in the strict sense
    of the word; others understand by it only cousin-german, according
    to the Hebrew phrase, and think that the Blessed Virgin was an
    only daughter.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;James was by birth a Galilean, and by profession a
    fisherman with his father and brother, living probably at
    Bethsaida, where St.&nbsp;Peter also dwelt at that time. Jesus
    walking by the lake of Genesareth saw St.&nbsp;Peter and
    St.&nbsp;Andrew fishing, and he called them to come after him,
    promising to make them fishers of men.<a id="c25_1a"> </a>Going on
    a little farther on the shore, he saw two other brothers, James
    and John, in a ship, with Zebedee their father, mending their
    nets, and he also called them; who forthwith left their nets and
    their father and followed him.<a
      href="#fn_282"
      class="anchor">282</a>
    Probably by conversing with St.&nbsp;Peter their townsman, and by
    other means, they had before this call an entire conviction that
    Jesus was the Christ; and no sooner did they hear his invitation,
    and saw the marks of his divine will directing them to what was
    eminently conducive to his honor, but the same moment they quitted
    all things to comply with this summons. They held no consultation,
    made no demur, started no difficulties, thought of no consequences
    or dangers; and their sacrifice was most perfect and entire. Like
    Abraham, they preferred obedience to the divine command, before
    all the endearments of their nearest relations, and forsook all
    they had, and all their hopes and prospects in the world, to
    become the disciples of Jesus. Zebedee their father seems to have
    approved of their resolution, and their mother Salome devoted
    herself heartily to the service of our Lord, as the gospels
    frequently mention. All fervent souls ought to be in the like
    dispositions of perfect sacrifice with these apostles, without the
    least inordinate attachment to any thing on earth, being most
    ready to renounce everything if God’s greater glory should require
    it. With what boundless liberality does the Divine Spirit shower
    down his choicest treasures upon souls which thus perfectly open
    themselves to him! This the apostles, of whom we speak, happily
    experienced in themselves. But they for some time so followed
    Christ, and listened to his divine instructions, as still to
    return from time to time to their fishing trade for a maintenance.
    It was in the same first year of Christ’s preaching that Peter and
    Andrew, at the command of their divine Master, took a prodigious
    shoal of fishes by a miraculous draught. James and John were their
    partners, though in another boat, and were called in to assist in
    hauling up the nets.<a id="c25_1b"> </a>Astonished at this
    manifestation of Christ’s power, they entirely quitted their
    business, the more perfectly to attach themselves to him.<a
      href="#fn_283"
      class="anchor">283</a></p>
  <p>
    In the year&nbsp;31 St.&nbsp;James was present with his brothers
    St.&nbsp;John and St.&nbsp;Peter at the cure of St.&nbsp;Peter’s
    mother-in-law, and at the raising of the daughter of Jairus from
    the dead. This same year Jesus formed the college of his apostles,
    into which he adopted St.&nbsp;James and his brother
    St.&nbsp;John. He gave these two the surname of Boanerges, or Sons
    of Thunder, probably to denote their active zeal.<a id="c25_1c">
    </a>When a town of the Samaritans refused to entertain Christ,
    they suggested that he should call down fire from heaven to
    consume it; but our Blessed Redeemer gave them to understand that
    meekness and patience were the arms by which they were to
    conquer.<a
      href="#fn_284"
      class="anchor">284</a>
    Christ distinguished St.&nbsp;Peter, St.&nbsp;James, and
    St.&nbsp;John by many special favors above the rest of the
    apostles. They alone were admitted to be spectators first of his
    glorious transfiguration, and afterward of his agony and bloody
    sweat in the garden. The instructions and example of the Son of
    God had not fully enlightened the understandings of these
    apostles, nor purified their hearts, before the Holy Ghost had
    shed his beams upon them; and their virtue was still imperfect, as
    appeared in the following instance;—Mary Salome, the mother of
    James and John, relying upon their merit, and her relation to
    Christ, and imagining that he was going to erect a temporal
    monarchy, according to the notion of the carnal Jews concerning
    the Messias, presented to him a request that her two sons might
    sit, the one on his right hand and the other on his left, in his
    kingdom. By this example we are put in mind how often the fondness
    of parents renders them the spiritual murderers of their own
    children, and makes them blindly excuse, flatter, and encourage
    their secret vices and passions. At the same time we are taught
    how formidable an enemy ambition is, which could find admittance
    in the breasts of two apostles (though yet novices) before the
    descent of the Holy Ghost. They doubtless disguised their vice
    under the cloak of a reasonable desire, and a virtuous emulation
    of preferment, with a design of serving their Master by it. Only
    the children of light discover the deceit and snare of this enemy;
    only profound humility discerns and condemns the specious
    pretences of subtle pride and covetousness. The two sons of
    Zebedee seem to have spoken by the mouth of their mother;
    wherefore Christ directed his answer to them, telling them, they
    knew not what they asked; for in his kingdom preferments are
    attainable, not by the most forward and ambitious, but by the most
    humble, and most laborious, and the most patient. He therefore
    asked them if they were able to drink of his cup of suffering. The
    two apostles understanding the condition under which Christ
    offered them his kingdom, and glowing with ardor and courage to
    suffer, answered peremptorily they were able to do it. Our Lord
    told them, they should indeed have their portions of suffering;
    but for the honors of his kingdom, he could make no other disposal
    of them than according to his decrees in conjunction with his
    Father, in proportion to every one’s charity and patience in
    suffering.</p>
  <p>
    The virtue of the most fervent novices in the service of God is
    very imperfect, so long as entire self-denial, and a great
    assiduity and spirit of prayer have not yet prepared their souls
    for, and called down upon them a plentiful effusion of the Holy
    Ghost, who fills their understanding with a clear and new heavenly
    light, and by the ardor of his charity consumes the rust of the
    affections, and fills them with his fervor. In this state even the
    moral virtues acquire an heroic and infused degree of perfection.
    Humility now gives the soul a much more clear and feeling
    knowledge of her own infirmities, baseness, and imperfections,
    with much stronger sentiments of a just contempt of herself; and
    the like is to be said of divine and fraternal charity, and all
    other virtues; so that she seems to herself translated into a
    region of new light, in which by continual heroic acts of these
    virtues, and especially of prayer and contemplation, she makes
    daily and wonderful advances. This perfection the apostles
    received in a more miraculous manner by the descent of the Holy
    Ghost upon them, when he not only engraved the law of love deeply
    in their hearts, but also bestowed on them the external graces and
    gifts of prophecy and miracles, and qualified them for the
    execution of the great commission they had received from
    Christ.</p>
  <p>
    How St.&nbsp;James was employed in preaching and promoting the
    gospel after Christ’s ascension, we have no account from the
    writers of the first ages of Christianity. It appears that he left
    Judæa some time after the persecution that was raised at the
    martyrdom of St.&nbsp;Stephen in the year&nbsp;30, and was
    returned again ten years after when he suffered martyrdom. The
    addition to St.&nbsp;Jerom’s catalogue of illustrious men tells
    us, that he preached the gospel to the twelve tribes of the Jews,
    in their dispersion up and down the world. Though the apostles,
    during the first twelve years, preached generally in the
    neighborhood of Judea, yet St.&nbsp;James might in that interval
    make a voyage to Spain, and preach some time in that country, as
    Baronius observes. F.&nbsp;Cuper adds, that his martyrdom happened
    above a year after the dispersion of the apostles, in which space
    he had the fairest opportunity of visiting Spain. That he preached
    there is constantly affirmed by the tradition of that church,
    mentioned by St.&nbsp;Isidore, the Breviary of Toledo, the Arabic
    books of Anastasius patriarch of Antioch, concerning the Passions
    of the martyrs and others.<a id="c25_1d"> </a>Cuper the
    Bollandist<a
      href="#fn_285"
      class="anchor">285</a>
    traces this tradition very high, and confirms it from
    St.&nbsp;Jerom,<a
      href="#fn_286"
      class="anchor">286</a>
    St.&nbsp;Isidore, the ancient Spanish office, &amp;c., and from
    many corroborating circumstances. St.&nbsp;Epiphanius says, that
    St.&nbsp;James always lived a bachelor, in much temperance and
    mortification, never eating flesh nor fish; that he wore only one
    coat, and a linen cloak, and that he was holy and exemplary in all
    manner of conversation. He was the first among the apostles who
    had the honor to follow his divine master by martyrdom, which he
    suffered at Jerusalem, whither he was returned, in the eleventh
    year after our Lord’s ascension.</p>
  <p>
    Agrippa, the grandson of Herod, by Aristobulus, was author of this
    persecution.<a id="c25_1e"> </a>Being brought up at Rome in the
    reign of Tiberius, he, basely flattering Caligula in his passions,
    gained the confidence of that monster, who was no sooner placed on
    the imperial throne than he gave Agrippa the title of king, with
    the tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias, which were then vacant.<a
      href="#fn_287"
      class="anchor">287</a>
    Claudius, in the year&nbsp;41, enlarged his dominions, giving him
    also Jerusalem and all the rest of Judæa, Samaria, and whatever
    other provinces had been possessed by his grandfather Herod. He
    gave also to his younger brother Herod the little kingdom of
    Chalcis in Syria, near mount Labinus. Agrippa reigned with great
    state and magnificence. Being very fond of pleasing the Jewish
    nation, when he came from Cæsarea to Jerusalem to keep the
    Passover in the year&nbsp;43, he began to persecute the
    Christians; and the first who fell a victim to his popular zeal
    was St.&nbsp;James the Great, whom he caused to be apprehended and
    beheaded there a little before Easter, in the year 43, about
    fourteen years after the death of Christ.<a id="c25_1f">
    </a>Clement of Alexandria, and from him Eusebius,<a
      href="#fn_288"
      class="anchor">288</a>
    relate that his accuser, observing the great courage and constancy
    of mind wherewith the apostle underwent his trial, was so affected
    with it, that he repented of what he had done, declared himself
    publicly a Christian, and was condemned to be beheaded with
    St.&nbsp;James. As they were both led together to execution, he
    begged pardon of the apostle by the way for having apprehended
    him. St.&nbsp;James, after pausing a little, turned to him, and
    embraced him, saying, <i>Peace be with you</i>.<a id="c25_1g">
    </a>He then kissed him, and they were both beheaded together.<a
      href="#fn_289"
      class="anchor">289</a>
    The body of the apostle was interred at Jerusalem; but not long
    after carried by his disciples into Spain, and deposited at Iria
    Flavia, now called El Padron, upon the borders of Gallicia. The
    sacred relics were discovered there in the beginning of the ninth
    century, in the reign of Alphonsus the Chaste, king of Leon. By
    the order of that prince they were translated to Compostella, four
    miles distant, to which place pope Leo&nbsp;III. transferred the
    episcopal see from Iria Flavia. This place was first called Ad
    S.&nbsp;Jacobum Apostolum, or Giacomo Postolo, which words have
    been contracted into the present name, Compostella. It is famous
    for the extraordinary concourse of pilgrims that resort thither to
    visit the body of St.&nbsp;James, which is kept with great respect
    in the stately cathedral.<a id="c25_1h"> </a>F.&nbsp;Cuper the
    Bollandist proves the truth of the tradition of the Spanish church
    concerning the body of St.&nbsp;James having been translated to
    Compostella, and gives authentic histories of many miracles
    wrought through his intercession, and of several apparitions by
    which he visibly protected the armies of a Christian against the
    Moors in that kingdom.<a
      href="#fn_290"
      class="anchor">290</a>
    The military order of St.&nbsp;James, surnamed the Noble, was
    instituted by Ferdinand&nbsp;II. in&nbsp;1175.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    The Church, by the martyrdom of St.&nbsp;James, lost in her
    infancy one of her main pillars; but God was pleased that his name
    should be glorified by so illustrious a testimony, and that it
    should appear he was the immediate supporter and defender of his
    Church. For when it was deprived of its chief members and pastors,
    it remained no less firm than before; and even grew and gathered
    strength from the most violent persecutions. The apostle with
    confidence committed his tender flock to God, and commended to
    them his own work, whilst he rejoiced to go to his Redeemer, and
    to give his life for him. We all meet with trials. But can we fear
    or hesitate to drink a cup presented to us by the hand of God, and
    which our Lord and Captain, by free choice, and out of pure love,
    was pleased himself to drink first for our sake? He asks us
    whether we can drink of his cup, he encourages us by setting
    before our eyes the glory of heaven, and he invites us by his own
    divine example. Let us humbly implore his grace, without which we
    can do nothing, and take with joy this cup of salvation, which he
    presents us with his divine hand.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;CHRISTOPHER,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    He suffered martyrdom under Decius in Lycia, and is honored on
    this day in the Martyrology which bears the name of
    St.&nbsp;Jerom, and in other western Calendars, but is
    commemorated by the Greeks and other Oriental nations on the 9th
    of May. The Mosarabic Breviary, attributed to St.&nbsp;Isidore,
    mentions the translation of his relics to Toledo, whence they were
    brought into France, and are at present shown enshrined at the
    abbey of St.&nbsp;Denys near Paris. He seems to have taken the
    name of Christopher upon the like motive that St.&nbsp;Ignatius
    would be called Theophorus, to express his ardent love for his
    Redeemer, by which he always carried him in his breast as his
    great and only good, his inestimable treasure, and the object of
    all his affections and desires.<a id="c25_2a"> </a>There seem to
    be no other grounds than this name for the vulgar notion of his
    great stature, the origin of which seems to have been merely
    allegorical, as Baronius observes, and as Vida has beautifully
    expressed in an epigram on this saint.<a
      href="#fn_291"
      class="anchor">291</a>
    The enormous statues of St.&nbsp;Christopher, still to be seen in
    many Gothic cathedrals, expressed his allegorical wading through
    the sea of tribulations, by which the faithful meant to signify
    the many sufferings through which he arrived at eternal life. They
    are monuments of the devotion of our ancestors to this saint,
    whose intercession they implored especially against pestilential
    distempers. Saint Gregory the Great mentions a monastery in Sicily
    which bore the name of St.&nbsp;Christopher. See Pinius the

    SAINTS THEA AND VALENTINA,&nbsp;VIRGINS,
    AND&nbsp;ST.&nbsp;PAUL,&nbsp;MM.</h3>
  <p>
    In the year&nbsp;308 there were at the same time six emperors,
    successors of Dioclesian, namely, in the East Galerius, Lucinius,
    and Maximinus; in the West, Constantine, Maxentius, and his
    father, Maximian Herculeus, who had reassumed the purple.<a
    id="c25_3a"> </a>Firmilian, the successor of Urbanus in the
    government of Palestine, under Maximinus&nbsp;II., carried on the
    persecution with great cruelty. When fourscore and seventeen
    confessors, men, women, and children, out of an innumerable
    multitude of Christians who were banished a long while before to
    the porphyry quarries in Thebais, were brought before him, he
    commanded the sinews of the joint of their left feet to be burnt
    with a hot iron; and their right eyes to be put out, and the eye
    holes burnt with a hot iron to the very bottom of the orb. In this
    condition he sent them to work at the mines in Palestine about
    mount Libanus. Many others were brought before this inhuman judge
    from different towns of Palestine, and were tormented various
    ways.</p>
  <p>
    Among the Christians taken at Gaza, whilst they were assembled to
    hear the holy scriptures read, was a holy virgin named Thea, whom
    the judge threatened with the prostitution of her chastity in the
    public stews. She, to whom her virtue was most dear, reproached
    him for such infamous injustices. Firmilian, enraged at her
    liberty of speech, caused her to be inhumanly scourged, then
    stretched on the rack, and her sides torn with iron hooks till the
    bare ribs appeared. Valentina, a pious Christian virgin of
    Cæsarea, who had also by vow consecrated her chastity to God,
    being present at this spectacle, cried out to the judge from the
    midst of the crowd, “How long will you thus torment my sister?”
    She was immediately apprehended, and being dragged by force to the
    altar, she threw herself upon it, and overturned it with her feet,
    together with the fire and sacrifice which stood ready upon it.
    Firmilian, provoked beyond bounds, commanded her sides to be more
    cruelly torn than any others. Being at length wearied with
    tormenting her, he ordered the two virgins to be tied together and
    burnt. This was executed on the 25th of July,&nbsp;308. One Paul,
    an illustrious confessor, was beheaded for the faith on the same
    day, by an order of this judge. The fervor with which he prayed at
    the place of execution for the emperor, the judge who condemned
    him, and his executioner, drew tears from all that were present.
    Soon after, one hundred and thirty Egyptian confessors, by an
    order of Maximinus, had one eye pulled out, and one foot maimed,
    and were sent, some to the mines in Palestine, others to those in
    Cilicia. See Eusebius de Martyr. Palestinæ, c.&nbsp;8; Tillemont,

    At Barcelona he is called St.&nbsp;Cougat, at Ruel, near Paris,
    St.&nbsp;Quiquenfat, in some other parts of France
    St.&nbsp;Guinefort. He was a native of Scillite in Africa, and one
    of the first families of that country. To escape the persecution
    raised by Dioclesian, he retired with St.&nbsp;Felix into
    Mauritania, and afterward into Spain. He was no sooner landed at
    Barcelona but he was apprehended, and confessing his faith before
    Dacian, the cruel governor, was condemned by him, after suffering
    many torments, to lose his head, in&nbsp;304. His companion,
    Felix, received a like crown soon after him in Gironne. The relics

    honored by the devotion of the faithful to this saint, who was the
    great model of virtue to all engaged in the married state, and
    charged with the education of children. It was a sublime dignity
    and a great honor for this saint to give to a lost world the
    advocate of mercy, and to be parent of the mother of God. But it
    was a far greater happiness to be, under God, the greatest
    instrument of her virtue, and to be spiritually her mother by a
    holy education in perfect innocence and sanctity. St.&nbsp;Anne,
    being herself a vessel of grace, not by name only, but by the
    possession of that rich treasure, was chosen by God to form his
    most beloved spouse to perfect virtue; and her pious care of this
    illustrious daughter was the greatest means of her own
    sanctification and her glory in the church of God to the end of
    ages. It is a lesson to all parents whose principal duty is the
    holy education of their children. By this they glorify their

    SAINT GERMANUS, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;AUXERRE,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was born at Auxerre about the year&nbsp;380, of noble parents.
    Having laid the foundation of sound literature at home, he studied
    eloquence and the civil law at Rome, and pleaded with great
    reputation in the court of the Præfectus-prætorio. He married a
    lady of great quality named Eustachia, and being taken notice of
    by the emperor Honorius, was raised by him to several honorable
    employments, and at last to that of duke in his own province,
    which dignity gave him the command over all the troops in that
    country. Germanus being returned to Auxerre, was careful to shun
    gross vices, but his religion seemed confined to principles of
    integrity, and his virtues were merely human; for he was
    unacquainted with the true spirit of mortification, humility, and
    prayer. The young duke had a passion for hunting, and hung up the
    heads of the wild beasts which he killed on a great tree in the
    middle of the city, as trophies of his diversion. No one could
    presume to show him the meanness and folly of this favorite petty
    vanity, by which he seemed to authorize the superstitious custom
    of the Pagans who did the like to honor their gods.
    St.&nbsp;Amator, who was at that time the zealous bishop of
    Auxerre, made him strong remonstrances on the danger of
    countenancing such remains of idolatry, but without effect. At
    last, watching an opportunity, he caused this tree to be cut down
    while Germanus was absent, who, upon hearing this news, grievously
    threatened the bishop. St.&nbsp;Amator withdrew for a while to
    Autun; where he learned by a revelation that Germanus was designed
    by God to be his successor. He therefore procured privately the
    consent of Julius, the prefect of Gaul, that he might give the
    tonsure to Germanus; for, by the laws, no officer could quit his
    employment without such a permission. Julius giving leave,
    St.&nbsp;Amator returned to Auxerre, and causing the church doors
    to be shut when Germanus was come in, he gave him the tonsure, and
    ordained him deacon. By this instance, it appears, that
    immediately after the general persecutions, clerks were
    distinguished by the tonsure. This proof is the stronger, as the
    priest Constantius wrote this life in the same age. Germanus durst
    not make any opposition for fear of resisting the will of God.
    St.&nbsp;Amator died soon after on the 1st of May in&nbsp;418, and
    St.&nbsp;Germanus was unanimously chosen by the clergy and people
    to succeed him, and consecrated by the bishops of the province on
    the 7th of July, notwithstanding the great reluctance he
    discovered.</p>
  <p>
    Full of a deep sense of the obligations of his new dignity, he
    became at once another man. He renounced all the pomps and
    vanities of the world, lived with his wife no otherwise than if
    she had been his sister, distributed all his possessions to the
    poor and to the Church, and embraced a life of poverty and
    austerity. From the day he was ordained bishop to his death, that
    is, for thirty years together, he never touched wheaten bread,
    wine, vinegar, oil, pulse, or salt. He began every meal by putting
    a few ashes in his mouth to renew in his soul a spirit of penance,
    and took no other sustenance than barley bread, which grain he had
    threshed and ground himself, that he might, as a true penitent,
    live by his own labor. He never ate but in the evening, sometimes
    about the middle of the week, often only on the seventh day. His
    dress was the same in winter and summer, and consisted of a cowl
    and tunic which he never changed till they were worn to pieces. He
    always wore a hair-cloth next his skin. His bed was enclosed with
    two boards, strewed with ashes, without a bolster, and covered
    with a sack-cloth and one blanket. He always carried about him
    some relics of saints in a little box, tied to a leather string.
    He extended his hospitality to all sorts of persons, washed the
    feet of the poor, and served them with his own hands, at the same
    time that he himself fasted. He built a monastery over against
    Auxerre, on the other side of the river Yone, in honor of
    SS.&nbsp;Cosmas and Damian, which now goes by the name of
    St.&nbsp;Marian’s, from one of its first abbots. He found the
    sepulchres of several martyrs, particularly of a great multitude
    who had been put to death in the persecution of Aurelian, with
    St.&nbsp;Priscus, otherwise called St.&nbsp;Bry, in a place called
    Coucy, where their bodies had been thrown into a cistern or pit
    out of which he took them, and built in their honor a church and
    monastery, called at this day <i>de Saints en Puy saye</i>.<a

    Seven of these he gave to the cathedral church, namely Appoigny,
    where his father and mother had been buried in St.&nbsp;John’s
    church; little Varsy, where stood a palace; great Varsy, Toucy,
    Poeilly, Marcigny, and Perigni. Three he settled on the monastery
    of St.&nbsp;Cosmas, namely, Monceaux, Fontenay, and Merilles. He
    bestowed three others, called Garchy, Concou, and Molins, on the
    church which he built in honor of St.&nbsp;Maurice, which at this
    day bears the name of St.&nbsp;Germanus himself. In this manner he
    reduced himself to great poverty, and to perpetuate the divine
    honor, and the relief of the indigent, enriched the church of
    Auxerre which he found very poor. By many like examples, it
    appears, that the great endowments of several churches were
    originally owing to the liberality of their bishops, as Fleury
    observes.</p>

    Pelagius began to dispute against the necessity of divine grace at
    Rome, about the year&nbsp;405. Being himself by birth a Briton, it
    is not to be wondered that he should have disciples in Britain.
    Among these one Agricola, the son of Severinus, who, after the
    birth of this son, was chosen bishop and became a Pelagian, spread
    the poison of this heresy in our island. The deacon Pelladius,
    whom pope Celestine had sent to the places infected with this
    heresy, and whom he afterward ordained bishop, and commissioned to
    go into Scotland, moved him to provide for the preservation of so
    many souls; and other Catholics in Britain had sent a deputation
    to the bishops in Gaul, entreating them to send over some able
    person to defend the faith and oppose the growing evil.<a
    id="c26_2b"> </a>Pope Celestine nominated St.&nbsp;Germanus of
    Auxerre to go thither in quality of his vicar in the
    year&nbsp;429, as St.&nbsp;Prosper assures us.<a
      href="#fn_297"
      class="anchor">297</a>
    <a id="c26_2c"> </a>The bishops of Gaul assembled in a numerous
    council for the same purpose, and agreed to entreat
    St.&nbsp;Lupus, who had then been only two years bishop of Troyes,
    to accompany St.&nbsp;Germanus in this important mission.<a
      href="#fn_298"
      class="anchor">298</a>
    These two holy prelates, proceeding on their journey, came to
    Nanterre near Paris, where St.&nbsp;Germanus gave his blessing and
    good counsel to St.&nbsp;Genevieve, and foretold her future
    sanctity.<a id="c26_2d"> </a>She being at that time about fifteen
    years old, and desirous to consecrate herself a virgin to God,
    St.&nbsp;Germanus, after many solemn prayers in the church,
    received there her vow, and confirmed it by laying his right hand
    upon her head.<a
      href="#fn_299"
      class="anchor">299</a></p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Germanus and St.&nbsp;Lupus embarking in the winter
    season, were overtaken with a furious tempest, which
    St.&nbsp;Germanus appeased by casting some drops of blessed oil,
    according to Constantius, but according to Bede, of holy-water,
    into the sea, having first invoked the adorable Trinity. Being
    arrived in Britain they were met by a great multitude of people
    and the fame of their sanctity, doctrine, and miracles soon filled
    the whole country. They confirmed the Catholics in all parts, and
    converted the heretics, preaching often in the highways and fields
    where the churches were not able to contain the crowd that flocked
    to them. The Pelagians everywhere shunned them; but being at
    length ashamed thus to condemn themselves by their flight and
    silence, accepted a conference. The disputation was held at
    Verulam before an incredible number of people. The heretics, who
    made their appearance with a great train and in rich apparel,
    spoke first. When they had talked a long time, the bishops
    answered them with great eloquence, and so invincibly supported
    their arguments with quotations from scripture, that their
    adversaries were fairly reduced to silence. The people applauded
    their victory with joyful acclamations. Before the assembly broke
    up, a certain tribune and his wife presented their little daughter
    of ten years of age, who was blind, to the two holy bishops; and
    they bid them take her to the Pelagians. But the latter joined the
    parents in begging the saints to pray for her. The two bishops
    made a short prayer; then Germanus called upon the Blessed
    Trinity; and taking from his neck the little box of relics which
    he wore, laid it upon the eyes of the girl before the whole
    assembly, who immediately recovered her sight, to the great joy of
    her parents and of all the people. From that day no one opposed
    the doctrine of the holy bishops. The saints went from this
    conference to return thanks to God at the tomb of St.&nbsp;Alban,
    the most illustrious martyr in Britain. St.&nbsp;Germanus caused
    his sepulchre to be opened, and deposited in it his box of relics
    of apostles and martyrs, taking from the same place a little of
    the dust which still retained some marks of the blood of
    St.&nbsp;Alban.<a id="c26_2e"> </a>This he carried away with him,
    and, at his return, built at Auxerre a church in his honor, where
    he placed these relics.<a

    The Saxons from Germany on one side, and on the other the Picts,
    at that time harassed the Britons. Paul the deacon tells us, that
    an army of Picts and Scots invaded their territories whilst the
    two bishops were in the island; and bishop Usher takes notice,
    that the Saxons and English who inhabited Sleswic, and all the
    German coast from Denmark to the Rhine, made descents upon Britain
    from time to time before the arrival of Hengist and Horsa
    in&nbsp;449. The Britons having assembled an army against these
    plunderers, invited the two holy bishops into their camp, hoping
    to be protected by their prayers and presence. The saints complied
    with their request, but employed their time in bringing the
    idolaters to the faith, and the Christians to a reformation of
    their manners. Many of the former demanded baptism, and the saints
    prepared them to receive it at Easter, for it was then Lent. They
    erected a church in the camp of green boughs twisted together, in
    which the catechumens received the sacrament of regeneration; and
    the whole army celebrated the festival with great devotion. After
    Easter, St.&nbsp;Germanus had recourse to a stratagem, by which,
    without bloodshed, he rescued his dear converts and the country
    out of the danger with which they were threatened. The enemy
    approaching, he put himself at the head of the Christians with so
    much skill and address as showed he had not forgotten his old
    profession of a general. He led his little army into a vale
    between two high mountains, and ordered his troops to send forth
    the same shout for which he would give them a sign. When the Saxon
    pirates came near them, he cried out thrice, <i>Alleluiah</i>,
    which was followed by the whole British army; and the sound was
    often repeated by the echo from the hills with as dreadful a noise
    as if the rocks had been rent asunder. The barbarians, in a sudden
    fright, judging from the shout that they were falling upon the
    swords of a mighty army, flung down their arms and ran away,
    leaving behind them all their baggage and a great booty.<a

    St.&nbsp;Germanus found his people loaded with extraordinary
    imposts, and undertook a journey to Arles, to solicit Auxiliaris,
    prefect of Gaul, in their behalf. On the road, the people
    everywhere met him in crowds, with the women and children, to
    receive his blessing. When he drew near to Arles, the prefect
    Auxiliaris himself, contrary to custom, was come a good way to
    meet him, and conducted him to the capital. He admired his
    gracefulness, and the charity and authority which his countenance
    and conversation displayed, and found him to exceed his
    reputation. He made him great presents, and entreated him to cure
    his wife who had been long ill of a quartan ague. He obtained his
    request, and granted to St.&nbsp;Germanus the discharge from the
    taxes which he had asked for his people. The saint being returned
    home, applied himself earnestly to reform their manners; but used
    to retire from time to time to his monastery of SS. Cosmas and
    Damian. In&nbsp;446 he was called again into Britain, to assist
    that church against the Pelagian heresy, which began a second time
    to raise its head there. He took for his companion
    St.&nbsp;Severus, who had been lately promoted to the
    archbishopric of Triers, and had formerly been a disciple of
    St.&nbsp;Lupus of Troyes. In Britain he sought out those who had
    been seduced by the heretics, and converted many of them; so that
    the obstinate sowers of those errors found no longer any retreat
    here, and quitted the island. A&nbsp;principal man of the country,
    called Elaphius, brought to him his son who was in the flower of
    his age, and had one ham contracted, and his leg withered.
    St.&nbsp;Germanus made him sit down, and touching his ham and leg,
    healed him in the presence of Many. St.&nbsp;Germanus considering
    that ignorance could not be banished, nor the reformation which he
    had established maintain its ground, without regular schools for
    the instruction of the clergy, instituted schools of learning, by
    which means,<a id="c26_2h"> </a>“These churches continued
    afterward pure in the faith, and free from heresy,” as Bede
    observes.<a
      href="#fn_304"
      class="anchor">304</a>
    In South-Wales, having ordained St.&nbsp;Iltutus priest, and
    St.&nbsp;Dubricius archbishop of Landaff, he charged them with the
    care of several schools, which soon grew very famous for the
    numbers, learning, and eminent sanctity of those that were there
    educated. Two of these, under the immediate direction of the
    latter, were seated at Hentlan and Moch-ros, places lying on the
    river Wye, where he had one thousand scholars, for years
    together.<a id="c26_2i"> </a>The names of the most eminent among
    them are mentioned in the life of St.&nbsp;Dubricius, written (as
    some maintain) by St.&nbsp;Thelian’s own hand in the ancient
    Landaff register.<a
      href="#fn_305"
      class="anchor">305</a>
    The schools of St.&nbsp;Iltutus at Llan-Iltut (now Lantwit) near
    Boverton, and at Llan-elty near Neath in Glamorganshire, were in
    like repute, and equally filled with the sons of the nobility from
    all parts of the island. Among his disciples we find
    St.&nbsp;Gildas, St.&nbsp;Leonorius bishop and confessor,
    St.&nbsp;Samson, St.&nbsp;Magloire, St.&nbsp;Malo, St.&nbsp;Paul
    afterward bishop of Leon, and Daniel, whom St.&nbsp;Dubricius made
    bishop of Bangor, where he likewise instituted a seminary for the
    Britons. Paulinus, another disciple of St.&nbsp;Germanus, did the
    like at Whiteland in Caermarthenshire, where St.&nbsp;David and
    St.&nbsp;Theliau studied. The seminaries of Llancarvan near
    Cowbridge, and the famous school of Bencor in Flintshire, were
    also noble monuments of St.&nbsp;Germanus’s zeal. This saint was
    on his road back when he met a deputation from the inhabitants of
    Armorica or Brittany who besought him to be their protector; for
    to punish them for a revolt, Aëtius, the Roman general in Gaul,
    had sent Eocarich, a Pagan and barbarous king of the Alemanni, to
    subdue them. St.&nbsp;Germanus boldly accosted the barbarian,
    stopping his horse by the bridle, at the head of his army. The
    German at first refused to hear him, but at length listened to his
    discourse, and by it was so much softened as to call off his
    troops, and agree not to ravage the province, on condition that he
    should obtain the pardon of the people from the emperor, or from
    his general Aëtius. In order to procure this the saint undertook a
    journey to Ravenna, where the emperor Valentinian&nbsp;III. then
    resided.</p>
  <p>
    He wrought several miracles on the way, and at Milan delivered a
    man who was possessed by the devil. He entered the city of Ravenna
    by night to avoid honors and pomp; but the people being aware of
    his precaution, a great crowd waited for him, and saluted him with
    acclamations. He was received with great joy by the bishop
    St.&nbsp;Peter Chrysologus; by the young emperor Valentinian, and
    his mother Placidia. She sent to his house a great silver vessel
    filled with dainties, without any flesh, which she knew he would
    never touch. The saint sent her in return a barley loaf upon a
    wooden dish. The empress received it graciously, ordered the dish
    to be enchased with gold, and kept the loaf by which several
    miraculous cures were performed. The emperor confirmed his
    request; but the restless people by raising new disturbances
    destroyed the effect of the imperial clemency. The saint was
    continually attended at Ravenna by six bishops, and wrought there
    many miracles. The son of Volusian, chancellor or secretary to the
    patrician Sigisvultus, being dead and cold, the saint was called,
    and having put all the company out of the chamber, he prostrated
    himself near the corpse and prayed with tears. After some time the
    dead man began to stir, opened his eyes, and moved his fingers.
    St.&nbsp;Germanus raised him, he sat up, and, by degrees, was
    restored to perfect health. One day after matins, as the saint was
    talking with the bishops of religious matters, he said to them,
    “My brethren, I&nbsp;recommend my passage to your prayers.
    Methought I&nbsp;saw this night our Saviour, who gave me provision
    for a journey, and told me it was to go into my native country,
    and to receive eternal rest.” A&nbsp;few days after, he fell sick.
    All the city was alarmed. The empress went to see him, and he
    desired the favor of her to send back his corpse into his own
    country; to which she assented, though very unwillingly. He died
    at Ravenna on the seventh day of his illness, which was the last
    of July in&nbsp;448, having held his see thirty years and
    twenty-five days. The empress Placidia took his reliquary,
    St.&nbsp;Peter Chrysologus his cowl and hair shirt, and the six
    other bishops divided his clothes among them. The eunuch Acholius,
    prefect of the emperor’s chamber, one of whose servants, when
    sick, the saint had cured, had his corpse embalmed; the empress
    clothed it with a rich habit and gave a coffin of cypress wood;
    the emperor furnished the carriages, the expense of the journey,
    and the officers to attend it. The funeral pomp was most
    magnificent; the number of lights was so great, that they shone as
    broad day. Everywhere as it passed, the people came to meet it,
    showing all manner of honors. Some levelled the ways and repaired
    the bridges, others bore the corpse, or at least sung psalms. The
    clergy of Auxerre went as far as the Alps to meet it. The sacred
    treasure was brought to that city fifty days after the saint’s
    death, and after having been exposed six days, was interred on the
    1st of October in the oratory of St.&nbsp;Maurice, which he had
    founded, where stands at present the famous abbey which bears his
    name. His principal festival is kept on the 31st of this month.
    St.&nbsp;Germanus was the titular saint of many churches in
    England, and of the great abbey of Selby in Yorkshire, the abbot
    whereof was a parliamentary baron. A&nbsp;chapel near Verulam, in
    which St.&nbsp;Germanus had preached, was a place of great
    devotion to him among our ancestors, and was afterward dedicated
    under his name. From him the parliamentary borough of
    St.&nbsp;German’s in Cornwall is called. See his life written by
    the priest Constantius, who was nearly his contemporary, and is
    commended by St.&nbsp;Sidonius Apollinaris in the same age: also
    Bede, and Nennius the British historian, who wrote in&nbsp;620.
    All these relate the miracles mentioned above. See also Leland’s
    Itinerary, Brown-Willis, Usher, Fleury, Tillemont, t.&nbsp;15,

    He was physician to the emperor Galerius Maximianus, and a
    Christian, but fell by a temptation which is sometimes more
    dangerous than the severest trials of the fiercest torments; for
    bad example, if not shunned, insensibly weakens, and at length
    destroys the strongest virtue. Pantaleon being perpetually
    obsessed by it in an impious idolatrous court, and deceived by
    often hearing the false maxims of the world applauded, was
    unhappily seduced into an apostasy. But a zealous Christian called
    Hermolaus, by his prudent admonitions awakened his conscience to a
    sense of his guilt, and brought him again into the fold of the
    Church. The penitent ardently wished to expiate his crime by
    martyrdom; and to prepare himself for the conflict, when
    Dioclesian’s bloody persecution broke out at Nicomedia
    in&nbsp;303, he distributed all his possessions among the poor.
    Not long after this action he was taken up, and in his house were
    also apprehended Hermolaus, Hermippus, and Hermocrates. After
    suffering many torments they were all condemned to lose their
    heads. St.&nbsp;Pantaleon suffered the day after the rest. He
    is ranked by the Greeks amongst the great martyrs. Procopius
    mentions a church in his honor at Constantinople, which being
    decayed was repaired by Justinian.<a id="c27_1a"> </a>His relics

    The saints who condemned as contrary to their penitential state,
    far-sought or exquisite means, with St.&nbsp;Charles Borromæo,
    were scrupulously attentive to essential prescriptions of
    physicians in simple and ordinary remedies. But let the Christian
    in sickness seek in the first place the health of his soul by
    penance, and the exercise of all virtues. Let him also consider
    God as his chief physician, begging him, if it may be conducive to
    his divine honor, to restore the frame he created, and entreating
    our Redeemer to stretch out that hand upon him, with which in his
    mortal state he restored so many sick to their health.<a

    So hidden are often the causes of distempers, so precarious the

    physicians, that their endeavors frequently check nature instead
    of seconding its efforts, and thus hasten death. The divine
    blessing alone is the Christian’s sheet-anchor, perfect
    resignation to the divine will is the secure repose of his soul;
    and the fervent exercise of penance, patience, and devotion, is
    his gain in the time of sickness.</p>

  <p class="subhead">
    COMMONLY CALLED THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.</p>
  <p>
    Having confessed the faith before the proconsul at Ephesus under
    Decius in&nbsp;250, they were walled up together in a cave in
    which they had hid themselves, and there slept in the Lord. Some
    moderns, mistaking this expression, have imagined that they only
    lay asleep, till they were found in&nbsp;479, under Theodosius the
    younger. The truth seems to be, that their relics were then
    discovered. They are much honored by the Greeks, Syrians, and all
    the Oriental nations. Their relics were conveyed to Marseilles in
    a large stone coffin, which is still shown there in
    St.&nbsp;Victor’s church. In the Musæum Victorium at Rome is a
    factitious plaster or stone (made of sulphur melted with fire and
    mortar), formed in imitation of a large precious stone, in which
    is cut a group of figures representing the Seven Sleepers with
    their names, and near Constantine and John are exhibited two
    clubs; near Maximian a knotty club; near Malchus and Martinian two
    axes; near Serapion a burning torch, and near Danesius (whom
    others call Dionysius) a great nail.<a id="c27_2a"> </a>That large
    nails (<i>clavi trabales</i>, or such as were used in joining

    SS. NAZARIUS AND CELSUS, MM.</h3>
  <p class="intro">
    From two sermons delivered on their festival, the one by
    St.&nbsp;Ennodius, the other passes under the name of
    St.&nbsp;Ambrose, and was written soon after his time, perhaps by
    St.&nbsp;Gaudentius of Brescia; also from Paulinus the deacon, in
    his life of St.&nbsp;Ambrose. See Tillemont, t.&nbsp;2, and Pinius
    the Bollandist, t.&nbsp;6, Julij, p.&nbsp;503.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    ABOUT THE YEAR 68.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Nazarius’s father was a heathen, and enjoyed a
    considerable post in the Roman army. His mother Perpetua was a
    zealous Christian, and was instructed by St.&nbsp;Peter, or his
    disciples, in the most perfect maxims of our holy faith. Nazarius
    embraced it with so much ardor, that he copied in his life all the
    great virtues he saw in his teachers; and out of zeal for the
    salvation of others left Rome, his native city, and preached the
    faith in many places with a fervor and disinterestedness becoming
    a disciple of the apostles. Arriving at Milan he was there
    beheaded for the faith, together with Celsus, a youth whom he
    carried with him to assist him in his travels. These martyrs
    suffered soon after Nero had raised the first persecution. Their
    bodies were buried separately in a garden without the city, where
    they were discovered and taken up by St.&nbsp;Ambrose in&nbsp;395.
    In the tomb of St.&nbsp;Nazarius a vial of the saint’s blood was
    found as fresh and red as if it had been spilt that day. The
    faithful stained handkerchiefs with some drops, and also formed a
    certain paste with it; a portion of which St.&nbsp;Ambrose sent to
    St.&nbsp;Gaudentius bishop of Brescia. St.&nbsp;Ambrose conveyed
    the bodies of the two martyrs into the new church of the apostles,
    which he had just built. A&nbsp;woman was delivered of an evil
    spirit in their presence.<a id="c28_1a"> </a>St.&nbsp;Ambrose sent
    some of these relics to St.&nbsp;Paulinus of Nola, who received
    them with great respect, as a most valuable present, as he
    testifies.<a
      href="#fn_319"
      class="anchor">319</a></p>
  <p>
    The martyrs died as the outcasts of the world, but are crowned by
    God with immortal honor.<a id="c28_1b"> </a>The glory of the world
    is false and transitory, and an empty bubble or shadow; but that
    of virtue is true, solid, and permanent, even in the eyes of men;
    for, to use the comparison of St.&nbsp;Basil,<a
      href="#fn_320"
      class="anchor">320</a>
    as the more we look upon the sun the more we admire it, and by
    reviewing it never find it less bright or less beautiful; so the
    memory of the martyrs which we celebrate, after so many years, is
    only more fresh in our minds, and will be more flourishing in all
    ages to come.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;VICTOR, POPE,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Africa, and succeeded St.&nbsp;Eleutherius in
    the pontificate, in the year 192, the nineteenth of Commodus. The
    practice of those virtues which had prepared him for that dignity,
    rendered him a true successor of the apostles. He vigorously
    opposed the rising heresies of that age. Theodotus of Byzantium, a
    tanner, having apostatized from the faith to save his life in a
    late persecution, afterward, to extenuate his guilt, pretended
    that he had denied only a man, not God; teaching that Christ was
    nothing more than a mere man, as the Socinians teach at this day;
    whereas the Arians allowed him to have been before the world,
    though himself a creature.<a id="c28_2a"> </a>Theodotus going to
    Rome, there drew many into his blasphemous error; for he was well
    versed in polite literature; but Victor checked his progress by
    excommunicating him with Ebion, Artemon, and another Theodotus who
    had taught the same blasphemy.<a
      href="#fn_321"
      class="anchor">321</a>
    This other Theodotus, called Trapezita, or the banker, was author
    of the Melchisedecian heresy, pretending that Melchisedec was
    greater than Christ.</p>
  <p>
    Montanus, a new convert in Mysia, near Phrygia, out of an
    unbounded desire of invading the first dignities of the Church,
    and filled with rage to see himself disappointed, began to preach
    against the Church; and having by pride and ambition given
    entrance to the devil, commenced false prophet, and sometimes
    losing his senses, began in an enthusiastic strain to utter
    extraordinary expressions. Prisca, or Priscilla, and Maximilla,
    two women of quality, but of debauched lives, left their husbands,
    and being filled with the same spirit, spoke like Montanus, void
    of sense, and after an extravagant and unusual manner, pretending
    they succeeded the prophets among the disciples of the apostles.
    Montanus placed himself above the apostles, saying, that he had
    received the Paraclete, or the Holy Ghost promised by Christ, to
    perfect his law. He denied that the Church had power to forgive
    the sins of idolatry, murder, and impurity, and hardly received
    any sinners on repentance. St.&nbsp;Paul had allowed second
    marriages, but Montanus forbade them as inconsistent with the
    perfect law of chastity; and he forbade Christians to flee in time
    of persecution.<a id="c28_2b"> </a>The Montanists were also called
    from their country Cataphryges, and Pepuzeni from Pepuzium, a
    little town in Phrygia, which was their capital, and which they
    called Jerusalem.<a
      href="#fn_322"
      class="anchor">322</a>
    They boasted of their martyrs, as the Marcionites also did; which
    other heretics seldom pretend to, as St.&nbsp;Irenæus and Origen
    take notice; nor could these have any great number. Apollonius, a
    Catholic writer quoted by Eusebius, confounding the hypocrisy of
    the Montanists, reproached their pretended prophetesses with
    infamous debaucheries, and with receiving presents, saying, “Does
    a prophet color his hair, paint his eye-brows, play at dice, or
    lend out money on usury? I&nbsp;will demonstrate that they are
    guilty of these things.” The Catholics met to examine their
    pretended new prophecies, and convicted them of falsehood, because
    the true prophets were not beside themselves when they spoke; also
    the Montanists had lied in their predictions, and opposed the
    doctrine of the Church. Asterius Urbanus, a learned priest (for he
    calls St.&nbsp;Zoticus fellow-priest), confounded them by these
    arguments, in a great conference held at Ancyra about the year
    188. Their prophecies and errors being condemned as impious, the
    followers of Montanus were driven out of the Church, and
    excommunicated. It was reported for certain, that Montanus and
    Maximilla, led away by the spirit that possessed them, afterward
    hanged themselves. These particulars are related by Eusebius.</p>
  <p id="c28_2c">
    Tertullian, who fell into this heresy about the time of the death
    of Pope Victor, says,<a
      href="#fn_323"
      class="anchor">323</a>
    that this pope at first admitted to the communion of the Church
    these pretended prophets. And it was easy to be deceived in a
    matter of fact concerning persons at such a distance, and who
    appeared under the garb of hypocrisy. But he had no sooner
    answered their letters, in which he acknowledged them brethren,
    but Praxeas coming from the East, brought him an ample account of
    their tenets and practice: and Victor immediately recalled his
    letters of communion, and condemned these innovators. This Praxeas
    was a Phrygian, and being puffed up because he had suffered
    imprisonment for the faith, began to sow a new heresy at Rome,
    maintaining but one person in God, and attributing crucifixion to
    the Father as well as to the Son; whence his followers were called
    Patripassians. His errors being brought to light, he was also cut
    off from the communion of the Church.</p>
  <p>
    About the same time Tatian fell from the Church. He was a Syrian,
    a Platonic philosopher, and a disciple of St.&nbsp;Justin, martyr,
    after whose death he taught some time at Rome. Afterward,
    returning into Syria in&nbsp;171, he there broached his errors,
    which he durst not advance at Rome. He borrowed several of them
    from Marcion, Valentinus, and Saturninus, teaching two principles,
    and that the Creator is the evil principle or God. He added
    several new errors, as that Adam was damned. He condemned marriage
    as no less criminal than adultery, whence his followers were
    called Encratitæ, or the continent.<a id="c28_2d"> </a>They were
    likewise called Hydroparastatæ, or Aquarii, because, in
    consecrating the eucharist, they used only water, for they
    condemned all use of wine, and likewise the use of flesh-meat.<a
      href="#fn_324"
      class="anchor">324</a>
    <a id="c28_2e"> </a>The ancients observe that Tatian’s fall was
    owing to pride, which often attends an opinion of knowledge;<a
      href="#fn_325"
      class="anchor">325</a>
    and of this there cannot be a more dangerous symptom in a scholar
    than a fondness for novelty and singularity, especially if joined
    with obstinacy and opiniativeness.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Victor was watchful to cut off these scandals in their
    root, and every where to maintain the purity of the faith with
    unity. Up an this motive, he exerted his zeal in the dispute about
    the time of celebrating Easter. The churches of Lesser Asia kept
    it with the Jews on the fourteenth day of the first moon after the
    vernal equinox, on whatever day of the week it fell. The Roman
    church, and all the rest of the world, kept Easter always on a
    Sunday immediately following that fourteenth day. Pope Anicetus
    permitted these Asiatics to keep their own custom, even at Rome;
    but Pope Soter, his successor, obliged them to conform to the
    custom of places where they should be. Several councils held at
    Rome, in Palestine, in Pontus, in Gaul, at Corinth, and other
    places, unanimously determined the point according to the Roman
    custom. Yet Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, wrote strenuously in
    defence of the Asiatic custom, which he said was derived from
    St.&nbsp;Philip who died at Hierapolis, from St.&nbsp;John
    Evangelist, St.&nbsp;Polycarp, bishop and martyr, Sagaris, bishop
    and martyr, who died at Laodicea, and others.<a id="c28_2f">
    </a>Victor seeing the Asiatics fixed in their resolution,
    threatened to cut them off from the communion of the Church; from
    the words of Eusebius<a
      href="#fn_326"
      class="anchor">326</a>
    some moderns infer with Baronius, Constant, and De Marca, that he
    excommunicated them in a letter, but immediately suspended or
    recalled the sentence: others with Thomassin, Natalis Alexander,
    and Graveson, think that he only threatened it; which opinion best
    agrees with the sequel.<a id="c28_2g"> </a>To reconcile the
    different passages of authors, F.&nbsp;John Philip Monti<a
      href="#fn_327"
      class="anchor">327</a>
    thinks pope Victor, upon receiving the refractory answer of
    Polycrates, drew up a sentence of excommunication, but never sent
    or published the same, being overcome by the advice of
    St.&nbsp;Irenæus. The schism which Blastus, a priest, had lately
    formed at Rome, upon the difference of this rite, for which he had
    been degraded by pope Eleutherius, probably made St.&nbsp;Victor
    more severe in extirpating a practice which became daily more
    dangerous to the unity of the Church; but prudence and charity
    recommended a toleration some time longer, which he was prevailed
    upon to grant, by a letter of St.&nbsp;Irenæus, who wrote to him
    on that subject in his own name, and in that of his brethren in
    Gaul. St.&nbsp;Victor died soon after this, in the year&nbsp;201,
    the ninth of Severus, after he had sat ten years. He is styled a
    martyr by some writers of the fifth age, and in an ancient
    pontifical written in&nbsp;530.<a id="c28_2h"> </a>Though Severus
    only published the edicts for his persecution in&nbsp;202, several
    Christians had suffered in his reign before that time, as
    Tillemont remarks.<a
      href="#fn_328"
      class="anchor">328</a>
    F.&nbsp;Pagi thinks St.&nbsp;Victor did not die by the sword,
    because in some Martyrologies he is called only confessor, though
    his dignity and zeal exposed him to continual persecutions, for
    which alone he might deserve the title of martyr. See Eusebius
    Hist. l.&nbsp;5, c.&nbsp;23. Orsi, Berti Diss. Hist. t.&nbsp;2,

    SAINT INNOCENT&nbsp;I., POPE&nbsp;AND&nbsp;CONFESSOR.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a native of Albano, near Rome; and, upon the death of pope
    Anastasius in&nbsp;402, was unanimously chosen to fill the
    pontifical chair. He ascended it by compulsion, and considering
    himself in it with trembling, he never ceased to beg of God the
    spirit of his holy wisdom and prudence, which he stood the more in
    need of, as the times in which he lived were more difficult.
    Alaric the Goth, with an army of barbarians, threatened to carry
    desolation over all Italy. The pope exhorted the faithful to
    receive the scourges of heaven with submission and humility, and
    undertook several journeys to negotiate a reconciliation between
    the emperor Honorius and Alaric, but in vain. The Goths received a
    great overthrow from the Roman army commanded by Stilico,
    in&nbsp;403. But Alaric led them a second time to attempt the
    plunder of Rome; and because Honorius refused to make him general
    of the imperial army, he took that city on the 24th of
    August,&nbsp;410, and abandoned it to the fury of his soldiers,
    excepting the church of SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul, to which he
    granted the privilege of a sanctuary. Pope Innocent was at that
    time absent with the emperor at Ravenna. The year following,
    Alaric being dead, his brother-in-law and successor Atulphus again
    plundered Rome.</p>
  <p>
    After the departure of the barbarians, the good pope hastened
    thither, and by his presence brought comfort and joy to that
    afflicted people. He taught them to draw an advantage from their
    sufferings by making a good use of them, and so much were the
    Heathens edified at the patience, resignation, and virtue with
    which the Christians suffered the loss of their goods and whatever
    was dear, without any murmuring or complaint, that they came in
    crowds desiring to be instructed in the faith and baptized. The
    pope labored incessantly to form them a holy people, always
    occupied in good works. His letters, especially those to
    Exuperius, the most holy bishop of Toulouse, and Decentius, bishop
    of Gubbio, in answer to their several queries, contain many useful
    rules, and judicious decisions. In the former, he says, that
    communion or absolution is never to be denied to dying penitents,
    that we may not imitate the hardness of the Novatians. In that to
    Decentius he says, that only bishops, who have the sovereignty of
    the priesthood, can confer the Holy Ghost in confirmation, by
    anointing the foreheads of persons baptized; and that he cannot
    recite the words of the form for fear of discovering the mysteries
    or sacraments to the infidels. He uses the same precaution in
    speaking of the sacrifice; so inviolable was the secret with
    which, out of respect, the primitive Christians treated the
    sacraments. In the same epistle, this pope mentioning the extreme
    unction which is given to the sick, he says, it cannot be
    administered to penitents before their reconciliation, because it
    is a sacrament; and all sacraments are refused them in that state.
    This evinces that it was held to be no less properly a sacrament
    than the eucharist. He indeed allows the custom that then
    prevailed for the laity to use the holy oils out of devotion, but
    without the sacramental words, and not as a sacrament; for being
    consulted whether bishops could give that sacrament, which was
    usually administered by priests, he proves that bishops can do it,
    because priests can; consequently, he supposes as undoubted, that
    only priests, not laymen, can minister this holy sacrament.</p>
  <p>
    When, in&nbsp;416, the councils of Carthage and Milevum had
    condemned the Pelagian errors, and wrote to the pope against them,
    the synodal letters of both these councils having been drawn up by
    St.&nbsp;Austin, St.&nbsp;Innocent, in his answer to the bishops
    of the council of Milevum, says, that “all ecclesiastical matters
    throughout the world are, by divine right, to be referred to the
    apostolic see, that is, to St.&nbsp;Peter, the author of its name
    and honor.”<a id="c28_3a"> </a>He commends the bishops of this
    council for so doing: “Following,” says he, “the ancient rule
    which you know with me, has been always observed by the whole
    world.”<a
      href="#fn_329"
      class="anchor">329</a>
    <a id="c28_3b"> </a>The confirmation given by pope Innocent to
    these two African councils being brought to Africa,
    St.&nbsp;Austin said,<a
      href="#fn_330"
      class="anchor">330</a>
    “The decisions of the two councils have been already sent to the
    apostolic see; the rescripts are also come from thence. The cause
    is now finished; would to God that the error may at last be at
    end.” St.&nbsp;Innocent closed his life with exerting his zeal in
    defence of divine grace, dying in 417, having been pope fifteen
    years. See his letters, and the councils, Ceillier, t. 10, p. 104,

    ST.&nbsp;SAMPSON, B.&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    He was a child of prayer, and was born about the year&nbsp;496, of
    noble parentage, in that part of South Wales which is now called
    Glamorganshire, then in the country of the Demetes, upon the
    borders of the Wenetes, who inhabited the province called by the
    Britons Guent, now Monmouthshire. At seven years of age he was put
    under the care of St.&nbsp;Iltutus, a very learned abbot in
    Glamorganshire, and having made great progress in learning and
    virtue, was ordained priest by Saint Dubritius, bishop of
    Caërleon. In&nbsp;512 he passed into a neighboring island; where
    he led an eremitical life, as did several others, under the
    direction of St.&nbsp;Piro, a holy priest. By an order of
    SS.&nbsp;Dubritius and Iltutus he paid a visit to his aged father
    who lay dangerously ill. The saint restored him by his prayers to
    his health, and converted him, and his whole numerous family,
    including his uncles, cousins, and brothers, whom he placed in
    several monasteries, but his father and an uncle in his own
    community of hermits. In&nbsp;516 he made a voyage into Ireland,
    to animate himself to fervor by the example and instructions of
    many illustrious saints who flourished there, and after his return
    shut himself up in a cave in a wilderness. In&nbsp;520
    St.&nbsp;Dubritius called him to a synod at Caërleon, and in it
    ordained him bishop without being fixed in any particular see.
    St.&nbsp;Sampson continued his former austere manner of life,
    abstaining wholly from flesh, sometimes eating only once in two or
    three days, and often passing the whole night in prayer standing,
    though sometimes when he watched the night, he took a little rest,
    leaning his head against a wall. To gain souls to God by the
    exercise of the ministry with which he saw himself intrusted, he
    passed over into Brittany in France, with his father and his
    cousin St.&nbsp;Magloire, and was followed by St.&nbsp;Maclou or
    Malo, another cousin.<a id="c28_4a"> </a>St.&nbsp;Sampson there
    converted many idolaters, raised a dead man to life, and wrought
    many other miracles. He founded a great abbey, which he called
    Dole,<a
      href="#fn_331"
      class="anchor">331</a>
    and fixed there the episcopal see which was before subject to
    Quidalet, now St.&nbsp;Malo’s.<a id="c28_4b"> </a>This see of Dole
    long enjoyed a metropolitical jurisdiction over all the bishops of
    Brittany.<a
      href="#fn_332"

    He subscribed to the second council of Paris, held in&nbsp;557, in
    the manner following, “I&nbsp;Sampson, a sinner, bishop, have
    consented and subscribed.” He used to have a cross carried before
    him, as is the custom of archbishops at present. He died about the
    year&nbsp;564. A&nbsp;considerable part of his relics was
    translated to Paris, with those of St.&nbsp;Magliore and
    St.&nbsp;Maclou, in the tenth century, for fear of the inroads of
    the Normans. See his life in Mabillon, Act. Bened. t.&nbsp;1,

    ST.&nbsp;MARTHA,&nbsp;V.</h3>
  <p>
    She was sister to Mary and Lazarus, and lived with them at
    Bethania, a small town two miles distant from Jerusalem, a little
    beyond mount Olivet. Our Blessed Redeemer had made his residence
    usually in Galilee, till in the third year of his public ministry
    he preached chiefly in Judæa, during which interval he frequented
    the house of these three holy disciples. Martha seems to have been
    the eldest, and to have had the chief care and direction of the
    household. It appears from the history of the resurrection of
    Lazarus that their family was of principal note in the country.<a
    id="c29_1a"> </a>In the first visit, as it seems, with which Jesus
    honored them,<a

    that St.&nbsp;Martha showed great solicitude to entertain and
    serve him. She forgot the privilege of her rank and riches, and
    would not leave so great an honor to servants only, but was
    herself very busy in preparing everything for so great a guest and
    his holy company. Mary sat all the while at our Saviour’s feet,
    feeding her soul with his heavenly doctrine. In this she found
    such inexpressible sweetness, and so great spiritual advantage,
    that she forgot and contemned the whole world, and would suffer
    nothing to draw her from her entertainment with her God, or make
    her lose any one of those precious moments. At his sacred
    discourses her heart was inflamed, her pure soul seemed to melt in
    holy love, and in a total forgetfulness of all other things she
    said to herself, with the spouse in the Canticles,<a id="c29_1b">

    that is with chaste souls, or among the flowers of virtues.
    St.&nbsp;Austin observes that this house represents to us the
    whole family of God on earth. In it no one is idle, but his
    servants have their different employments, some in the
    contemplative life, as recluses; others in the active; as, first,
    those who labor for the salvation of souls in the exterior
    functions of the pastoral charge; secondly, those who, upon pure
    motives of charity, serve the poor or the sick; and, lastly, all
    who look upon their lawful profession in the world as the place
    for which God has destined them, and the employment which he has
    given them; and who faithfully pursue its occupations with a view
    purely to accomplish the divine will, and acquit themselves of
    every duty in the order in which God has placed them in this
    world. He is the greater saint, whatever his state of life may be,
    whose love of God and his neighbor is more pure, more ardent, and
    more perfect; for charity is the soul and form of Christian
    perfection.</p>
  <p>
    But it has been disputed whether the contemplative or the active
    life be in itself the more perfect.<a id="c29_1c">
    </a>St.&nbsp;Thomas answers this question,<a
      href="#fn_336"
      class="anchor">336</a>
    proving from the example of Christ and his apostles, that the
    mixed life, which is made up of both, is the most excellent. This
    is the apostolic life, with the care of souls, if in it the
    external functions of instructing, assisting, and comforting
    others, which is the most noble object of charity, be supported by
    a constant perfect spirit of prayer and contemplation. In order to
    this, a long and fervent religious retirement ought to be the
    preparation which alone can form the perfect spirit of this state;
    and the same must be constantly nourished and improved by a
    vehement love and frequent practice of holy retirement, and a
    continued recollection, as Christ during his ministry often
    retired to the mountains to pray;<a id="c29_1d"> </a>for that
    pastor who suffers the spirit of prayer to languish in his soul,
    carries about a dead soul in a living body, to use the expression
    of St.&nbsp;Bonaventure.<a
      href="#fn_337"
      class="anchor">337</a>
    The like interior must animate; and some degree of assiduity in
    the like exercises, as circumstances will allow, must support
    those who are engaged in worldly employs, and those who devote
    themselves to serve Christ’s most tender and afflicted members,
    the poor and the sick, as Martha served Christ himself.</p>
  <p>
    With so great love and fervor did Martha wait on our Redeemer,
    that, as we cannot doubt, she thought that if the whole world were
    occupied in attending so great a guest, all would be too little.
    She wished that all men would employ their hands, feet, and
    hearts, all their faculties and senses, with their whole strength,
    in serving with her their gracious Creator, made for us our
    brother. Therefore, sweetly complaining to him, she desired him to
    bid her sister Mary to rise up and help her. Our meek and loving
    Lord was well pleased with the solicitude and earnestness, full of
    affection and devotion, wherewith Martha waited on him; yet he
    commended more the quiet repose with which Mary attended only to
    that which is of the greatest importance, the spiritual
    improvement of her soul. <i>Martha, Martha,</i> said he, <i>thou
    art careful and troubled about many things; but one thing is
    necessary.</i> If precipitation or too great eagerness had any
    share in her service, this would have been an imperfection; which,
    nevertheless, does not appear. Christ only puts Martha in mind
    that though corporal duties ought not to be neglected, and if
    sanctified by a perfect intention of charity are most excellent
    virtues, yet spiritual functions, when they come in competition,
    are to be preferred. The former, indeed, become spiritual, when
    animated by a perfect spirit and recollection; but this is often
    much impaired by the distraction of the mind, and in the course of
    action. In our external employments, which we direct with a pure
    intention to fulfil the divine will, we imitate the angels when
    they are employed by God in being our guardians, or in other
    external functions with which God hath charged them; but as these
    blessed spirits in such employs never lose sight of God, so ought
    we in all our actions to continue, at least virtually, to adore
    and praise his holy name; but herein the eye of the soul is often
    carried off, or its attention much weakened, whereas, in heavenly
    contemplation, the heart is wholly taken up in God, and more
    perfectly united to him by adoration and love. This is the
    novitiate of heaven, where it is the uninterrupted occupation of
    the blessed. In this sense Christ so highly commends the choice of
    Mary, affirming that her happy employment would never be taken
    from her. He added, “<i>One thing is necessary</i>;” which words
    some explain as if he had said, “A little is enough, one dish
    suffices;” but the word <i>necessary</i> determines the sense
    rather to be, as St.&nbsp;Austin, St.&nbsp;Bernard, Maldonatus,
    Grotius, and others, expound it, eternal salvation is our only
    affair.</p>
  <p>
    Another instance which shows how dear this devout family was to
    our divine Saviour, is the raising of Lazarus to life. When he
    fell sick, the pious sisters sent to inform Christ, who was then
    absent in Galilee. They said no more in their message than this:
    <i>He whom thou lovest is sick.</i> They knew very well that this
    was enough; and that his tender bowels would be moved to
    compassion by the bare representation of their calamity. It was
    not to remove our corporal miseries that Christ came from heaven,
    and died and suffered so much; this was not the object which drew
    down this Almighty Physician among us. If, in his mortal life on
    earth, he healed the sick and raised the dead, by these miracles
    he would manifest, as by sensible tokens, the spiritual cures
    which he desired to work in our souls. We groan under the weight
    of innumerable and the most dreadful spiritual miseries. Our
    tender Redeemer knows their horrible depth and endless extent; but
    he would have us to conceive a just sense of them, to acknowledge
    them, and earnestly to implore his aid; for this he sheds the rays
    of his light upon our blind souls, and rouses us by his repeated
    graces. The first step towards a deliverance is, that we confess,
    with a feeling sense, our extreme baseness and ingratitude, and
    our weakness and total incapacity of doing anything of ourselves
    towards our recovery; but we have a physician infinitely tender
    and powerful. To him then we must continually lay open our
    distress, and with deep compunction display our miseries before
    his holy eyes, earnestly striving by this dumb eloquence to move
    him to pity; exposing to him that we whom he loveth still as the
    work of his hands, as the price of his blood, lie ingulfed in
    unspeakable miseries. Thus we must entreat him, with tears and
    loud cries of our hearts, to look down on his image in our souls,
    now disfigured and sullied with sin; on his kingdom left desolate
    by the tyranny of the devil and our passions: on the vineyard
    which himself had planted, adorned, and fenced, but which is laid
    waste by merciless robbers and enemies; and that he would stretch
    out his almighty hand to repair these breaches, and save us. So
    long as life lasts we can never be sure that we shall find mercy,
    or rest secure of the issue of our great trial upon which our
    eternity depends; so long, therefore, we ought never to cease,
    with most earnest cries, to implore the clemency of our Judge,
    laying open our spiritual miseries to him in these words of the
    two sisters,—“Behold he, whom thou lovest, is sinking under the
    weight of his evils,” and beg him to remember his ancient love and
    mercies towards us. We ought also in corporal distempers to
    address ourselves to God with the like words, begging with Martha
    our own or our brother’s corporal health, if this may be expedient
    to our souls, and conducive to the divine honor.</p>
  <p>
    In all these petitions we ought to implore the joint supplications
    of the saints, as at the entreaties of the sisters Christ raised
    Lazarus. Having received their message, he wanted no other
    prompter than that of his own compassion and affection; an emblem
    of the paternal mercy with which he draws to himself, and receives
    penitent sinners. Had the prodigal son offered any plea of merits
    or deserts, he had never deserved to find favor; but he knew the
    goodness and tenderness of his father, who had with restless
    nights waited with impatience to see him return. The tender parent
    wanted no motives drawn from other objects or things without
    himself. The paternal affection within his own breast pleaded in
    favor of his disobedient child. By this his very bowels yearned to
    embrace him again, and raise him from spiritual death to life.
    This same tenderness and compassion in Christ was the grounds of
    the sisters’ confidence. Jesus, however, deferred setting out two
    or three days, that his glory might be more manifested by the
    greater evidence of the miracle, and by the trial of the virtue
    and confidence of the two holy sisters. When he arrived at
    Bethania, Martha went first out to meet and welcome him; and then
    called her sister Mary. The presence of Jesus brings every
    blessing and comfort; and, by it, the sisters had the joy to see
    their brother again restored to life when he had been four days in
    the grave.</p>
  <p>
    Christ was again at Bethania, at the house of Simon the Leper, six
    days before his passion. Lazarus was one of the guests.<a
    id="c29_1e"> </a>Martha waited at table; and Mary poured a box of
    costly ointments on our Lord’s feet, which she wiped with the hair
    of her head.<a
      href="#fn_338"
      class="anchor">338</a>
    Judas Iscariot complained of this waste, saying that the ointment
    might have been sold, and the price given to the poor. Not that he
    had any regard for the poor, but, bearing the common purse, he
    converted things sometimes to his own use, being a thief. How
    imperceptible a vice is covetousness, and how subtle in excuses to
    deceive itself! Charity interprets the actions of others in the
    best part; but passion hurries men into rash judgments. Judas
    condemned the most heroic virtue and devotion of a saint; but
    Jesus undertook her defence. He was pleased not with the ointment,
    but with the love and devotion of his fervent servant, which he
    suffered her to satisfy by that action, which he received as
    performed for the embalming of his body, his death being then at
    hand. He, moreover, declared that this good work which Judas
    condemned, should be commended to the edification of his servants
    over the whole world wherever his gospel should be preached.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Martha seems to have been one of those holy women who
    attended Christ during his passion, and stood under his cross.
    After his ascension, she came to Marseilles, and ended her life in
    Provence, where her body was found at Tarascon, soon after the
    discovery of that of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen. It lies in a
    magnificent subterraneous chapel of the stately collegiate church
    at Tarascon, which is dedicated to God in her honor. King
    Louis&nbsp;XI. gave a rich bust of gold, in which the head of the
    saint is kept.</p>
  <hr class="tbk" />
  <p>
    We have all, like St.&nbsp;Martha, one only necessary affair; that
    for which alone God created and redeemed us; for which he has
    wrought so many wonderful mysteries in our favor, and upon which
    the dreadful alternative of sovereign and everlasting happiness or
    misery depends. This is, that we refer even all our worldly
    employments and all that we do, to glorify God, to fulfil his
    will, and to save our souls. In this, all our thoughts, desires,
    and enterprises, ought to centre: this is the circle in which we
    must shut ourselves up, and never think of moving out of.<a
    id="c29_1f"> </a>Every one ought sincerely to say with an ancient
    writer, “I&nbsp;have but one only affair; and I&nbsp;care for
    nothing else only lest any other thing should take off any part of
    my attention from this my only business.”<a

    What account will they be able to give to themselves or to their
    Judge at the last day, who make vanity, pastimes, and idle
    employments, the sole business of their life? or they who toil and
    slave much in bustling through the world, seeming to neglect
    nothing but their only affair.</p>

    SS. SIMPLICIUS AND FAUSTINUS, BROTHERS, AND&nbsp;BEATRICE,

  <p>
    The two brothers were cruelly tormented, and at length beheaded at
    Rome in the persecution of Diocletian, in the year&nbsp;303. Their
    sister Beatrice took up their bodies out of the Tiber, and gave
    them burial. She lay herself concealed seven months in the house
    of a virtuous widow called Lucina, with whom she spent her time,
    night and day, in fervent prayer, and in the exercise of other
    good works. She was discovered and impeached by a pagan kinsman,
    who designed to possess himself of her estate, which was
    contiguous to his own; she resolutely protested to the judge that
    she would never adore gods of wood and stone, and was strangled by
    his order in prison the night following. Lucina buried her body
    near her brothers on the side of the highway to Porto, in the
    cemetery called Ad Ursum Pileatum. Pope Leo translated their
    relics into a church which he built to their honor in the city:

    ST.&nbsp;WILLIAM, BISHOP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;S.&nbsp;BRIEUC
    IN&nbsp;BRITTANY,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;William Pinchon, of an illustrious family in Brittany,
    was, by the innocence of his manners, his admirable meekness,
    humility, chastity, mortification, charity, and devotion, an
    accomplished model of all virtues. He received the tonsure, and
    some years after the holy orders of deacon and priest, at the
    hands of Josselin, bishop of S.&nbsp;Brieuc, served that church
    under his two successors, Peter and Sylvester, and succeeded the
    latter in the episcopal dignity about the year&nbsp;1220. The poor
    were his treasurers, and not content to exhaust on them whatever
    he possessed, he often borrowed great stores of corn and other
    necessary provisions for their relief. The bare boards were
    usually his bed; for his domestics discovered that he never made
    use of the soft bed which they prepared for him. The assiduous
    application to all the functions of his charge was no hindrance to
    his nourishing within himself the spirit of recollection and holy
    prayer. He died about the year&nbsp;1234, on the 29th of July, on
    which his name occurs in the Roman Martyrology. His body was
    deposited in his cathedral, and taken up incorrupt in&nbsp;1248.
    He was canonized by Innocent&nbsp;IV. in&nbsp;1253, according to
    Baronius. See Lobineau, Vies des SS.&nbsp;de Bretagne,

    He was son of Herald Grenscius, prince of Westfold in Norway, by
    his wife Asta, daughter of Gulbrand Kuta, governor of Gulbrand’s
    Dale or Valley. He delivered his country from the tyranny under
    which the Swedes and Danes had for some time held it, whilst
    Norway was divided between Sweno, king of Denmark, Olave
    Scot-Konung, son of Eric, king of Sweden, and Eric, son of Hacon

    successfully assisted king Ethelred against the Danes after the
    death of Sueno or Swayn their king.<a id="c29_4a"> </a>He

    St.&nbsp;Olave brought over from England several pious and learned
    priests and monks, one of whom, named Grimkele, was chosen bishop
    of Drontheim, his capital. The holy king did nothing without the
    advice of this prelate, and by his counsels published many
    wholesome laws, and abolished such ancient laws and customs as
    were contrary to the Gospel; which he did not only in Norway, but
    also in the isles of Orkney and of Iceland; though the entire
    conquest of Orkney was reserved to his son Magnus, who also
    subdued the isle of Man, as Camden relates from the ancient
    Chronicle of Man.</p>
  <p>
    Our religious king having settled his dominions in peace, set
    himself to extirpate out of them the abominable superstitions of
    idolatry. He travelled in person from town to town, exhorting his
    subjects to open the eyes of their souls to the bright light of
    faith. A&nbsp;company of zealous preachers attended him, and he
    demolished in many places the idolatrous temples. The heathens
    rebelled, and with the assistance of Canutus the Great, defeated
    and expelled him. St.&nbsp;Olave fled into Russia, whence he soon
    after returned, and raised an army in order to recover his
    kingdom, but was slain by his rebellious and infidel subjects in a
    battle fought at Stichstadt, north of Drontheim, on the 29th of
    July,&nbsp;1030, having reigned sixteen years. These rebels seem
    to have been in the interest of Canute the Great, who arrived from
    England in Norway, took possession of that kingdom, and left his
    nephew Hackin viceroy, but he being soon after drowned at sea,
    Canute made his son Sweno viceroy of Norway. Saint Olave’s body
    was honorably buried at Drontheim, and the year following bishop
    Grimkele commanded him to be honored in that church among the
    saints with the title of martyr. His son Magnus was called home
    from Russia in&nbsp;1035, and restored to the throne. Sweno, who
    saw himself entirely abandoned, fled into Sweden. Magnus
    exceedingly promoted the devotion of the people to the memory of
    his father, the martyr, who was chosen titular saint of the
    cathedral of Drontheim. This church was rebuilt with such splendor
    and magnificence, as to have been the glory and pride of all the
    North. Munster has given us a minute description of it, after
    Lutheranism was introduced; but it was soon after burnt by
    lightning. The body of St.&nbsp;Olave was found incorrupt
    in&nbsp;1098; and again when the Lutherans, in&nbsp;1541,
    plundered the shrine, which was adorned with gold and jewels of an
    immense value, a treasure nowhere equalled in the North. The ship
    which carried the greatest part of this sacrilegious booty
    perished at sea in the road to Denmark; the rest was robbed at
    land, so that nothing of it came into the king of Denmark’s hands.
    The Lutherans treated the saint’s body with respect, and left it
    in the same place where the shrine had stood, in the inner wooden
    case, till in 1568 they decently buried it in the same cathedral.
    A&nbsp;shirt or inner garment of St.&nbsp;Olave’s is shown at
    St.&nbsp;Victor’s in Paris. His shrine became famous by many
    miracles, and he was honored with extraordinary devotion
    throughout all the northern kingdoms, and was titular saint of
    several churches in England and Scotland. He was called by our
    ancestors St.&nbsp;Olave, and more frequently St.&nbsp;Tooley; but
    in the Norway Chronicles Olaf Haraldson, and Olaf Helge or the
    Holy. See Saxo-Grammaticus, Hist. Dan. l.&nbsp;10, fol.&nbsp;94,

  <p>
    They were Persians, but coming to Rome, courageously confessed the
    faith of Christ in the persecution of Decius in&nbsp;250. They
    were cruelly tormented, but the more their bodies were mangled and
    covered with ghastly wounds, the more were their souls adorned and
    beautified with divine grace, and rendered glorious in the sight
    of heaven. The Christians at Rome did not treat them as strangers,
    but as brethren united to them in the hope of the same blessed
    country; and after their death carefully deposited their bodies in
    the house of a subdeacon called Quirinus. In the reign of
    Constantine the Great, their relics were removed into the ancient
    burying place of Pontian, so called from some rich man who built
    it: called also, from some sign, Ad Ursum Pileatum. It afterward
    received its name from SS.&nbsp;Abdon and Sennen. It was situated
    near the Tiber, on the road to Porto near the gates of Rome.<a

    The martyrs preferred torments and death to sin, because the love
    of God above all things reigned in their breasts.<a id="c30_1c">
    </a>“We say we are Christians,” says Tertullian;<a
      href="#fn_344"
      class="anchor">344</a>
    “we proclaim it to the whole world, even under the hands of the
    executioner, and in the midst of all the torments you inflict upon
    us to compel us to unsay it. Torn and mangled, and weltering in
    our blood, we cry out as loud as we are able to cry, That we are
    worshippers of God through Christ.” Upon which Mr. Reeves
    observes, that no other religion ever produced any considerable
    number of martyrs except the true one. Do we ever read of any
    generation of men so greedy of martyrdom, who thought it long till
    they were upon the rack, and were so patient, so cheerful and
    steadfast under the most intolerable torments? Socrates was the
    only philosopher that can be said to have died for his doctrine;
    and what a restless posture of mind does he betray, who was
    esteemed the best and the wisest of the heathens!<a id="c30_1d">
    </a>With what misgivings, and fits of hope and fear, does he
    deliver himself in that most famous discourse, supposed to have
    been made by him a little before his death, about a future
    state!<a
      href="#fn_345"
      class="anchor">345</a>
    And neither Phædo, Cebes, Crito, Simmias, nor any other of his
    greatest friends who were present at his death, durst maintain
    either his innocence, or that doctrine for which he died, in the
    Areopagus. With what reserve did Plato himself dogmatize
    concerning the gods whom he worshipped in public, but denied in
    private! How did he dodge about, disguise himself, and say and
    unsay the same excellent truths! Only the Christians suffered at
    this rate, and they held on suffering for several hundred years
    together, till they had subdued the world by dying for their
    religion. What could engage such a number of men in such a
    religion, and support them in it, in defiance of death in the most
    shocking forms, but evident truth, and a superior grace and
    strength from above?</p>

    ST.&nbsp;JULITTA,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    The emperor Dioclesian, by the first edicts which he issued out
    against the Christians in&nbsp;303, declared them infamous, and
    debarred from all protection of the laws, and from all the
    privileges of citizens. By thus putting arms into the hands of
    every one against them, the tyrant hoped to see their very name
    extinguished; but he was not sensible that this divine religion
    then triumphs when its professors seem to be overcome by death,
    and that by it human weakness is made victorious over the power of
    the world and hell. Of this St.&nbsp;Julitta is an instance. She
    was a rich lady of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and was possessed of
    many farms, cattles, goods, and slaves. A&nbsp;powerful man of the
    town, by open violence, got possession of a considerable part of
    her estate; and when he could not otherwise maintain his suit
    before the pretor, charged her with being a Christian. The judge
    caused fire and incense to be immediately brought into the court,
    and commanded her to offer sacrifice to the idols; but she
    courageously made him this answer, “May my estates perish, or be
    disposed of to strangers; may I&nbsp;also lose my life, and may
    this my body be cut in pieces rather than that by the least
    impious word I&nbsp;should offend God that made me. If you take
    from me a little portion of this earth, I&nbsp;shall gain heaven
    for it.” The judge was extremely exasperated at the undaunted
    resolution with which she spoke, and without more ado confirmed to
    the usurper the estates to which he unjustly laid claim, and
    condemned the servant of Christ to the flames. Upon hearing this
    sentence, a kind of heavenly joy and most amiable cheerfulness
    flushed her countenance, which she could not refrain from
    expressing by continual thanksgiving to God to her last breath.
    She exhorted the Christians in the most moving manner to constancy
    and fervor. The Pagans were amazed to see a lady of her rank, age,
    and fortune, possessed of all the advantages necessary to please
    the world, and yet in a condition to enjoy all that is in it most
    flattering, to contemn all this, and life itself with such an
    heroic constancy.</p>
  <p>
    When all things were ready for the execution, Julitta laid herself
    cheerfully upon the pile, and there expired, being, as it seems,
    stifled by the smoke; for the flame, rising in an arched vault
    round her body, did not touch it, and the Christians took it up
    entire. It was afterward interred in the porch of the principal
    church in the city; and St.&nbsp;Basil, speaking of this treasure
    about the year&nbsp;375, wrote as follows: “It enriches with
    blessings both the place and those who come to it.” He assures us
    that “the earth which received the body of this blessed woman sent
    forth a spring of most pleasant water, whereas all the neighboring
    waters are brackish and salt. This water preserves health, and
    relieves the sick.” Both the Greeks and Latins honor
    St.&nbsp;Julitta on this day. See St.&nbsp;Basil’s homily on
    St.&nbsp;Julitta, t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;33, hom.&nbsp;5: also in
    Ruinart’s collection, p.&nbsp;515.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;IGNATIUS OF&nbsp;LOYOLA,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FOUNDER OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS.</p>
  <p class="intro">
    His life was written by F.&nbsp;Lewis Gonzales or Gonzalvo, who
    was a long time the saint’s confessor, and died at Lisbon
    in&nbsp;1575; and again by Ribadeneira, who had intimately
    conversed with the saint, and died at Madrid in&nbsp;1611. It is
    elegantly compiled in Latin by Maffei, who died at Tivoli
    in&nbsp;1603; in Italian by Bartoli, at Rome about&nbsp;1650; and
    in French by Bouhours, one of the ablest and most judicious of the
    modern French critics in polite literature, who died at Paris
    in&nbsp;1704. Pinius the Bollandist gives the original lives,
    Julij, t.&nbsp;7, p.&nbsp;409, and adds the history of many
    miracles wrought by the intercession of this saint; also,
    Baillet.</p>
  <p class="subhead">
    A. D. 1556.</p>
  <p>
    The conversion of many barbarous nations, several heretofore
    unknown to us, both in the most remote eastern and western
    hemisphere; the education of youth in learning and piety, the
    instruction of the ignorant, the improvement of all the sciences,
    and the reformation of the manners of a great part of Christendom,
    is the wonderful fruit of the zeal with which this glorious saint
    devoted himself to labor in exalting the glory of God, and in
    spreading over the whole world that fire which Christ himself came
    to kindle on earth. St.&nbsp;Ignatius was born in&nbsp;1491, in
    the castle of Loyola, in Guipuscoa, a part of Biscay that reaches
    to the Pyrenean mountains. His father, Don Bertram, was lord of
    Ognez and Loyola, head of one of the most ancient and noble
    families of that country. His mother, Mary Saez de Balde, was not
    less illustrious by her extraction. They had three daughters and
    eight sons. The youngest of all these was Inigo or Ignatius; he
    was well shaped, and in his childhood gave proofs of a pregnant
    wit and discretion above his years; was affable and obliging, but
    of a warm or choleric disposition, and had an ardent passion for
    glory. He was bred in the court of Ferdinand&nbsp;V. in quality of
    page to the king, under the care and protection of Antony
    Manriquez, duke of Najara, grandee of Spain, who was his kinsman
    and patron; and who, perceiving his inclinations, led him to the
    army, took care to have him taught all the exercises proper to
    make him an accomplished officer. The love of glory and the
    example of his elder brothers who had signalized themselves in the
    wars of Naples, made him impatient till he entered the service. He
    behaved with great valor and conduct in the army, especially at
    the taking of Najara, a small town on the frontiers of Biscay; yet
    he generously declined taking any part of the booty in which he
    might have challenged the greatest share. He hated gaming as an
    offspring of avarice, and a source of quarrels and other evils;
    was dexterous in the management of affairs, and had an excellent
    talent in making up differences among the soldiers. He was
    generous, even towards enemies, but addicted to gallantry, and
    full of the maxims of worldly honor, vanity, and pleasures. Though
    he had no tincture of learning, he made tolerably good verses in
    Spanish, having a natural genius for poetry. A&nbsp;poem which he
    composed in praise of St.&nbsp;Peter was much commended.</p>
  <p>
    Charles&nbsp;V., who had succeeded king Ferdinand, was chosen
    emperor, and obliged to go into Germany. Francis&nbsp;I., king of
    France, a martial prince, having been his competitor for the
    empire, resented his disappointment, and became an implacable
    enemy to the emperor and the house of Austria. He declared war
    against Charles, with a view to recover Navarre, of which
    Ferdinand had lately dispossessed John of Albert, and which
    Charles still held, contrary to the treaty of Noyon, by which he
    was obliged to restore it in six months. Francis, therefore,
    in&nbsp;1521, sent a great army into Spain, under the command of
    Andrew de Foix, younger brother of the famous Lautrec, who,
    passing the Pyrenees, laid siege to Pampeluna, the capital of
    Navarre. Ignatius had been left there by the viceroy, not to
    command, but to encourage the garrison. He did all that lay in his
    power to persuade them to defend the city, but in vain. However,
    when he saw them open the gates to the enemy, to save his own
    honor, he retired into the citadel with one only soldier who had
    the heart to follow him. The garrison of this fortress deliberated
    likewise whether they should surrender, but Ignatius encouraged
    them to stand their ground. The French attacked the place with
    great fury, and with their artillery made a wide breach in the
    wall, and attempted to take it by assault. Ignatius appeared upon
    the breach, at the head of the bravest part of the garrison, and,
    with his sword in his hand, endeavored to drive back the enemy;
    but, in the heat of the combat, a shot from a cannon broke from
    the wall a bit of stone, which struck and bruised his left leg;
    and the ball itself in the rebound broke and shivered his right
    leg. The garrison seeing him fall, surrendered at discretion.</p>
  <p>
    The French used their victory with moderation, and treated the
    prisoners well, especially Ignatius, in consideration of his
    quality and valor. They carried him to the general’s quarters, and
    soon after sent him, in a litter carried by two men, to the castle
    of Loyola, which was not far from Pampeluna. Being arrived there
    he felt great pain; for the bones had been ill set, as is often
    the case in the hurry after a battle. The surgeons therefore
    judged it necessary to break his leg again, which he suffered
    without any concern. But a violent fever followed the second
    setting, which was attended with dangerous symptoms, and reduced
    him to an extreme degree of weakness, so that the physicians
    declared that he could not live many days. He received the
    sacraments on the eve of the feast of SS.&nbsp;Peter and Paul, and
    it was believed he could not hold out till the next morning.
    Nevertheless God, who had great designs of mercy upon him, was
    pleased to restore him to his health in the following manner:
    Ignatius always had a singular devotion to St.&nbsp;Peter, and
    implored his intercession in his present distress with great
    confidence. In the night, he thought he saw in a dream that
    apostle touch him, and cure him. When he awaked he found himself
    out of danger; his pains left him, and his strength began to
    return, so that he ever after looked upon this recovery as
    miraculous; yet he still retained the spirit of the world. After
    the second setting of his leg, the end of a bone stuck out under
    his knee, which was a visible deformity. Though the surgeons told
    him the operation would be very painful, this protuberance he
    caused to be cut off, merely that his boot and stockings might sit
    handsomely; and he would neither be bound nor held, and scarce
    ever changed countenance whilst the bone was partly sawed and
    partly cut off, though the pain must have been excessive. Because
    his right leg remained shorter than the left, he would be for many
    days together put upon a kind of rack, and with an iron engine he
    violently stretched and drew out that leg; but all to little
    purpose, for he remained lame his whole life after.</p>
  <p>
    During the cure of his knee he was confined to his bed, though
    otherwise in perfect health, and finding the time tedious, he
    called for some book of romances, for he had been always much
    delighted with fabulous histories of knight-errantry. None such
    being then found in the castle of Loyola, a book of the lives of
    our Saviour, and of the saints, was brought him. He read them
    first, only to pass away the time, but afterward began to relish
    them and to spend whole days in reading them. He chiefly admired
    in the saints their love of solitude and of the cross. He
    considered among the anchorets many persons of quality who buried
    themselves alive in caves and dens, pale with fasting, and covered
    with haircloth; and he said to himself, “These men were of the
    same frame I&nbsp;am of; why then should not I&nbsp;do what they
    have done?” In the fervor of his good resolutions he thought of
    visiting the Holy Land, and becoming a hermit. But these pious
    notions soon vanished; and his passion for glory, and a secret
    inclination for a rich lady in Castile, with a view to marriage,
    again filled his mind with thoughts of the world; till returning
    to the lives of the saints, he perceived in his own heart the
    emptiness of all worldly glory, and that only God could content
    the soul. This vicissitude and fluctuation of mind continued some
    time; but he observed this difference, that the thoughts which
    were from God filled his soul with consolation, peace, and
    tranquillity; whereas the others brought indeed some sensible
    delight, but left a certain bitterness and heaviness in the heart.
    This mark he lays down in his book of Spiritual Exercises, as the
    ground of the rules for the discernment of the Spirit of God and
    the world in all the motions of the soul; as does cardinal Bona,
    and all other writers who treat of the discernment of spirits in
    the interior life. Taking at last a firm resolution to imitate the
    saints in their heroic practice of virtue, he began to treat his
    body with all the rigor it was able to bear; he rose at midnight,
    and spent his retired hours in weeping for his sins.</p>
  <p>
    One night being prostrate before an image of the Blessed Virgin,
    in extraordinary sentiments of fervor, he consecrated himself to
    the service of his Redeemer under her patronage, and vowed an
    inviolable fidelity. When he had ended his prayer he heard a great
    noise; the house shook, the windows of his chamber were broken,
    and a rent was made in the wall which remains to this day, says
    the latest writer of his life.<a id="c31_1a"> </a>God might by
    this sign testify his acceptance of his sacrifice; as a like sign
    happened in the place where the faithful were assembled after
    Christ’s ascension,<a
      href="#fn_346"
      class="anchor">346</a>
    and in the prison of Paul and Silas;<a
      href="#fn_347"
      class="anchor">347</a>
    or this might be an effect of the rage of the devil. Another
    night, Ignatius saw the Mother of God environed with light,
    holding the infant Jesus in her arms; this vision replenished his
    soul with spiritual delight, and made all sensual pleasure and
    worldly objects insipid to him ever after. The saint’s eldest
    brother, who was then, by the death of their father, lord of
    Loyola, endeavored to detain him in the world, and to persuade him
    not to throw away the great advantages of the honor and reputation
    which his valor had gained him. But Ignatius being cured of his
    wounds, under pretence of paying a visit to the duke of Najara,
    who had often come to see him during his illness, and who lived at
    Navarret, turned another way, and sending his two servants back
    from Navarret to Loyola, went to Montserrat. This was a great
    abbey of near three hundred Benedictin monks, of a reformed
    austere institute, situate on a mountain of difficult access,
    about four leagues in circumference and two leagues high, in the
    diocess of Barcelona. The monastery was first founded for nuns by
    the sovereign counts of Barcelona about the year&nbsp;880, but was
    given to monks in&nbsp;990. It has been much augmented by several
    kings of Spain, and is very famous for a miraculous image of the
    Blessed Virgin, and a great resort of pilgrims.</p>
  <p>
    There lived at that time in this monastery a monk of great
    sanctity, named John Chanones, a Frenchman, who being formerly
    vicar-general to the bishop of Mirepoix, in the thirty-first year
    of his age, resigned his ecclesiastical preferments, and took the
    monastic habit in this place. He lived to the age of eighty-eight
    years, never eating any flesh, watching great part of the night in
    prayer, dividing his whole time between heavenly contemplation and
    the service of his neighbor; and giving to all Spain an example of
    the most perfect obedience, humility, charity, devotion, and all
    other virtues. To this experienced director, Ignatius addressed
    himself, and after his preparation, was three days in making to
    him a general confession, which he often interrupted by the
    abundance of his tears. He made a vow of perpetual chastity, and
    dedicated himself with great fervor to the divine service. At his
    first coming to this place he had bought, at the village of
    Montserrat, a long coat of coarse cloth, a girdle, a pair of
    sandals, a wallet, and a pilgrim’s staff, intending, after he had
    finished his devotions there, to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
    Disguised in this habit, he remained at the abbey. He communicated
    to his director a plan of the austerities he proposed to practise,
    and was confirmed by him in his good resolutions. He received the
    blessed eucharist early in the morning on the feast of the
    Annunciation of our Lady in&nbsp;1522; and on the same day left
    Montserrat for fear of being discovered, having given his horse to
    the monastery, and hung up his sword on a pillar near the altar in
    testimony of his renouncing the secular warfare, and entering
    himself in that of Christ. He travelled with his staff in his
    hand, a scrip by his side, bare-headed, and with one foot bare,
    the other being covered because it was yet tender and swelled. He
    went away infinitely pleased that he had cast off the livery of
    the world, and put on that of Jesus Christ. He had bestowed his
    rich clothes on a beggar at his coming out of Montserrat; but the
    poor man was thrown into prison on suspicion of theft. Ignatius
    being sent after by the magistrates, and brought back, told the
    truth to release him, but would not discover his own name.</p>
  <p>
    Three leagues from Montserrat is a large village called Manresa,
    with a convent of Dominicans, and a hospital without the walls for
    pilgrims and sick persons. Ignatius went to this hospital, and
    rejoicing to see himself received in it unknown and among the
    poor, began to fast on water and the bread (which he begged) the
    whole week, except Sundays, when he ate a few boiled herbs, but
    sprinkled over with ashes. He wore an iron girdle and a hair
    shirt; disciplined himself thrice a day, slept little, and lay on
    the ground. He was every day present at the whole divine office,
    spent seven hours on his knees at prayer, and received the
    sacraments every Sunday. To add humiliation to his bodily
    austerities, he affected a clownishness in his behavior, and went
    begging about the streets with his face covered with dirt, his
    hair rough, and his beard and nails grown out to a frightful
    length. The children threw stones at him, and followed him with
    scornful shouts in the streets. Ignatius suffered these insults
    without saying one word, rejoicing secretly in his heart to share
    in the reproaches of the cross. The more mortifying the
    noisomeness of the hospital and the company of beggars were, the
    more violence he offered to himself that he might bear them
    cheerfully. The story of the fine suit of clothes given to the
    beggar at Montserrat, and the patience and devotion of the holy
    man, made him soon to be reverenced as some fervent penitent in
    disguise. To shun this danger, he privately hid himself in a dark
    deep cave in a solitary valley, called The Vale of Paradise,
    covered with briars, half a mile from the town. Here he much
    increased his mortifications till he was accidentally found half
    dead, and carried back to Manresa and lodged in the hospital.</p>
  <p>
    After enjoying peace of mind and heavenly consolations from the
    time of his conversion, he was here visited with the most terrible
    trial of fears and scruples. He found no comfort in prayer, no
    relief in fasting, no remedy in disciplines, no consolation from
    the sacraments, and his soul was overwhelmed with bitter sadness.
    The Dominicans, out of compassion, took him out of the hospital
    into their convent; but his melancholy only increased upon him. He
    apprehended some sin in every step he took, and seemed often on
    the very brink of despair; but he was in the hands of him whose
    trials are favors. He most earnestly implored the divine
    assistance, and took no sustenance for seven days, till his
    confessor obliged him to eat. Soon after this, his tranquillity of
    mind was perfectly restored, and his soul overflowed with
    spiritual joy. From this experience he acquired a particular
    talent for curing scrupulous consciences, and a singular light to
    discern them. His prayer was accompanied with many heavenly
    raptures, and he received from God a supernatural knowledge and
    sense of sublime divine mysteries: yet he concealed all from the
    eyes of men, only disclosing himself to his two confessors, the
    pious monk of Montserrat, and the Dominican of Manresa; however,
    the people began to reverence him as a living saint, which they
    particularly testified during a violent fever into which his
    austerities cast him three times.</p>
  <p>
    Too nice a worldly prudence may condemn the voluntary humiliations
    which this saint sometimes made choice of; but the wisdom of God
    is above that of the world; and the Holy Ghost sometimes inspires
    certain heroic souls to seek perfectly to die to themselves by
    certain practices which are extraordinary, and which would not be
    advisable to others; and if affected or undertaken with obstinacy
    and against advice, would be pernicious and criminal. Ignatius, by
    perfect compunction, humility, self-denial, contempt of the world,
    severe interior trials, and assiduous meditation, was prepared, by
    the divine grace, to be raised to an extraordinary gift of
    supernatural prayer. He afterward assured F.&nbsp;Lainez that he
    had learned more of divine mysteries by prayer in one hour at
    Manresa, than all the doctors of the schools could ever have
    taught him. He was there favored with many raptures, and divine
    illustrations concerning the Trinity, of which he afterward spoke
    with so much light and unction, that the most learned admired him,
    and the ignorant were instructed. In like manner, in various
    wonderful ecstasies, he was enlightened concerning the beauty and
    order of the creation, the excess of divine love which shines
    forth to man in the sacrament of the altar, and many other
    mysteries. So imperfect was his knowledge of his duties when he
    first renounced the world, that hearing a certain Moresco or
    Mahometan speak injuriously of the holy mother of God, when he set
    out from Loyola to Montserrat, he deliberated whether, being an
    officer, he ought not to kill him, though the divine protection
    preserved him from so criminal an action. But at Manresa he made
    so good a progress in the school of virtue, as to become qualified
    already to be a guide to others. He stayed there almost a year,
    during which time he governed himself by the advice of the holy
    monk of Montserrat, whom he visited every week, and that of his
    Dominican director.</p>
  <p>
    Spain, in that and the foregoing age, abounded with many learned
    and experienced persons in that way, endowed with an eminent
    spirit, and a perfect experimental knowledge of Christian piety;
    witness the works of St.&nbsp;Peter of Alcantara, John of Avila,
    St.&nbsp;Teresa, Bartholomew de Martyribus, Louis of Granada, and
    others. Our saint had the happiness to fall into the hands of
    prudent and able guides, and giving his heart to God without
    reserve, became himself in a short time an accomplished master;
    and whereas he at first only proposed to himself his own
    perfection, he afterward burned with an ardent desire of
    contributing to the salvation of others; and commiserating the
    blindness of sinners, and considering how much the glory of God
    shines in the sanctification of souls purchased with the blood of
    his Son, he said to himself, “It is not enough that I&nbsp;serve
    the Lord; all hearts ought to love him, and all tongues ought to
    praise him.” With this view, in order to be admitted more freely
    to converse with persons in the world, he chose a dress which,
    being more decent than the penitential garments which he at first
    wore, might not be disagreeable to others; and he moderated his
    excessive austerities.</p>
  <p id="c31_1b">
    He began then to exhort many to the love of virtue, and he there
    wrote his Spiritual Exercises, which he afterward revised, and
    published at Rome in&nbsp;1548.<a
      href="#fn_348"
      class="anchor">348</a>
    Though the saint was at that time unacquainted with learning any
    further than barely to read and write, yet this book is so full of
    excellent maxims and instructions in the highest points of a
    spiritual life, that it is most clear that the Holy Ghost supplied
    abundantly what was yet wanting in him of human learning and
    study. The spirit which reigns in this book was that of all the
    saints. Frequent religious retirement had been practised by pious
    persons, in imitation of Christ and all the saints from the
    beginning; likewise the use and method of holy meditation were
    always known; but the excellent order of these meditations,
    prescribed by Ignatius, was new: and, though the principal rules
    and maxims are found in the lessons and lives of the ancient
    fathers of the desert, they are here judiciously chosen,
    methodically digested, and clearly explained. One of these is,
    that a person must not abridge the time, or desist from
    meditating, on account of spiritual dryness; another, that no one
    make any vow in sudden sentiments of fervor, but wait some time,
    and first ask advice. St.&nbsp;Ignatius establishes in this book
    the practice of a daily particular examination against a person’s
    predominant passion, or on the best means and endeavors to acquire
    some particular virtue, besides the daily general examination of
    conscience.<a id="c31_1c"> </a>He lays down this excellent
    maxim;<a
      href="#fn_349"
      class="anchor">349</a>
    “When God hath appointed out a way, we must faithfully follow it,
    and never think of another, under pretence that it is more easy
    and safe. It is one of the devil’s artifices to set before a soul
    some state, holy indeed, but impossible to her, or at least
    different from hers; that by this love of novelty, she may dislike
    or be slack in her present state, in which God hath placed her,
    and which is best for her. In like manner he represents to her
    other actions as more holy and profitable to make her conceive a
      disgust of her present employment.” When some pretended to find
    fault with this book of St.&nbsp;Ignatius’s Spiritual Exercises,
    pope Paul&nbsp;III. at the request of St.&nbsp;Francis Borgia, by
    a brief in&nbsp;1548, approved it, as full of the Spirit of God,
    and very useful for the edification and spiritual profit of the
    faithful.</p>
  <p>
    The pestilence which raged in Italy having ceased, Ignatius, after
    a stay of ten months at Manresa, left that place for Barcelona,
    neither regarding the tears of those who sought to detain him, nor
    admitting any to bear him company, nor consenting to accept any
    money for the expenses of his journey. He took shipping at
    Barcelona, and in five days landed at Gaeta, whence he travelled
    on foot to Rome, Padua, and Venice, through villages, the towns
    being shut for fear of the plague. He spent the Easter at Rome,
    and sailed from Venice on board the admiral’s vessel, which was
    carrying the governor to Cyprus. The sailors were a profligate
    crew, and seemed entirely to neglect prayer and all duties of
    religion, and their discourse was often lewd and profane. Ignatius
    having reproved them for their licentiousness, his zeal made them
    conspire to leave him ashore in a desert island; but a gust of
    wind from the land hindered the ship from touching upon it. He
    arrived at Cyprus, and found in the port a vessel full of
    pilgrims, just ready to hoist sail. Going immediately on board, he
    made a good voyage, and landed at Jaffa, the ancient Joppa, on the
    last day of August,&nbsp;1523, forty days after he had left
    Venice. He went on foot from thence to Jerusalem in four days. The
    sight of the holy places filled his soul with joy and the most
    ardent sentiments of devotion and compunction, and he desired to
    stay there to labor in the conversion of the Mahometans. The
    provincial of the Franciscans, by virtue of his authority from the
    holy see over the pilgrims, commanded him to leave Palestine.
    Ignatius obeyed, but slipt privately back to satisfy his devotion
    again in visiting twice more the print of our Saviour’s feet on
    mount Olivet.</p>
  <p>
    He returned to Europe in winter, in extreme cold weather, poorly
    clad, and came to Venice at the end of January, in&nbsp;1524; from
    whence he continued his journey by Genoa to Barcelona. Desiring to
    qualify himself for the functions of the altar, and for assisting
    spiritually his neighbor, he began at Barcelona to study grammar,
    and addressed himself to a famous master named Jerom Ardebal,
    being assisted in the meantime in his maintenance by the charities
    of a pious lady of that city, called Isabel Rosella. He was then
    thirty-three years old; and it is not hard to conceive what
    difficulties he must go through in learning the rudiments of
    grammar at that age. Moreover, he seemed, by his military
    employments, and after his retreat by his contemplative life, very
    unfit for such an undertaking. At first, his mind was so fixed
    only on God, that he forgot everything he read, and conjugating
    <i>amo</i>, for example, could only repeat to himself,
    “I&nbsp;love God; I&nbsp;am loved by God,” and the like; but
    resisting this as a temptation, he began to make some progress,
    still joining contemplation and extraordinary austerities with his
    studies. He bore the jeers and taunts of the little boys, his
    schoolfellows, with joy. Hearing that a poor man called Lasano had
    hanged himself on a beam in his chamber, he ran to him, cut the
    rope, and prayed by him till the man returned to himself, though
    he had before seemed perfectly dead to all the bystanders. Lasano
    made his confession, received the sacraments, and soon after
    expired. This fact was regarded in the city as miraculous.</p>
  <p>
    Some persons persuaded Ignatius to read Erasmus’s Christian
    Soldier, an elegant book written by that master of style, at the
    request of an officer’s pious lady, for the use of her husband, a
    man of loose morals. The saint always found his heart dry after
    reading this or any other of that author’s works; which made him
    afterward caution those of his society against reading them, at
    least very much. Though in that writer’s paraphrase on the Lord’s
    prayer and other such treatises of piety, we find very pious
    sentiments collected from great authors, and elegantly and
    concisely expressed, yet a devout reader finds the language of the
    heart wanting. On the other side, it is well known how much
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius read daily, and recommended to all others the
    incomparable book, Of the Imitation of Christ, which he made
    frequent use of to nourish and increase the fervor of his soul. He
    lodged at the house of one Agnes Pascal, a devout woman. Her son,
    John Pascal, a pious youth, would sometimes rise in the night to
    observe what Ignatius did in his chamber, and saw him sometimes on
    his knees, sometimes prostrate on the ground, his countenance on
    fire, and often in tears, repeating such words as these:
    “O&nbsp;God, my love, and the delight of my soul, if men knew thee
    they could never offend thee! My God, how good art thou to bear
    with such a sinner as I&nbsp;am!”</p>
  <p>
    The saint, after studying two years at Barcelona, went to the
    university of Alcala, which had been lately founded by cardinal
    Ximenes, where he attended at the same time to lectures in logic,
    physics, and divinity; by which multiplicity he only confounded
    his ideas, and learned nothing at all, though he studied night and
    day. He lodged in a chamber of an hospital, lived by begging a
    small subsistence, and wore a coarse grey habit, in which he was
    imitated by four companions. He catechised children, held
    assemblies of devotion in the hospital, and by his mild
    reprehensions converted many loose livers, and, among others, one
    of the richest prelates in Spain. Some accused him of sorcery, and
    of the heresy of certain visionaries lately condemned in Spain
    under the name of the Illuminati, or Men of New Light: but, upon
    examination, he was justified by the inquisitors. After this, for
    teaching the catechism, being a man without learning or authority,
    he was accused to the bishop’s grand vicar, who confined him to
    close prison two-and-forty days, but declared him innocent of any
    fault by a public sentence on the 1st day of June,&nbsp;1527; yet
    forbidding him and his companions to wear any singular habit, or
    to give any instructions in religious matters, being illiterate
    persons. Ignatius rejoiced in his jail that he suffered, though
    innocent, but spoke with such piety that many called him another
    St.&nbsp;Paul in prison. Being enlarged, he went about the streets
    with a public officer to beg money to buy a scholar’s dress, in
    which action he rejoiced at the insults and affronts which he met
    with. However, he went himself to the archbishop of Toledo,
    Alphonsus de Fonseca, who was much pleased with him, but advised
    him to leave Alcala, and go to Salamanca, promising him his
    protection. Ignatius, in this latter place, began to draw many to
    virtue, and was followed by great numbers, which exposed him again
    to suspicions of introducing dangerous practices, and the
    grand-vicar of Salamanca imprisoned him; but, after two-and-twenty
    days, declared him innocent, and a person of sincere virtue.
    Ignatius looked upon prisons, sufferings, and ignominy, as the
    height of his ambition; and God was pleased to purge and sanctify
    his soul by these trials. Recovering his liberty again, he
    resolved to leave Spain.</p>
  <p>
    He from that time began to wear shoes, and received money sent him
    by his friends, but in the middle of winter travelled on foot to
    Paris, where he arrived in the beginning of February,&nbsp;1528.
    He spent two years in perfecting himself in the Latin tongue; then
    went through a course of philosophy. He lived first in Montaigue
    college; but, being robbed of his money, was obliged to lodge in
    the hospital of St.&nbsp;James, to beg his bread from day to day,
    and in the vacation time to go into Flanders, and once into
    England, to procure charities from the Spanish merchants settled
    there, from whom and from some friends at Barcelona he received
    abundant supplies. He studied his philosophy three years and a
    half in the college of St.&nbsp;Barbara. He had induced many of
    his schoolfellows to spend the Sundays and holydays in prayer, and
    to apply themselves more fervently to the practice of good works.
    Pegna, his master, thought he hindered their studies, and finding
    him not corrected by his admonitions, prepossessed Govea,
    principal of the college of St.&nbsp;Barbara, against him, so that
    he was ordered by him to undergo the greatest punishment then in
    use in that university, called <i>The Hall</i>, which was a public
    whipping; that this infamy might deter others from following him.
    The regents came all into the hall with rods in their hands, ready
    to lash the seditious student. Ignatius offered himself joyfully
    to suffer all things; yet, apprehending lest the scandal of this
    disgrace should make those whom he had reclaimed fall back, when
    they saw him condemned as a corrupter of youth, went to the
    principal in his chamber, and modestly laid open to him the
    sentiments of his soul, and the reasons of his conduct; and
    offered himself as much as concerned his own person, that any
    sacrifice should be made of his body and fame, but begged of him
    to consider the scandal some might receive, who were yet young and
    tender in virtue. Govea made him no answer, but taking him by the
    hand led him into the hall, where, at the ringing of the bell, the
    whole college stood ready assembled. When all saw the principal
    enter, and expected the sign for the punishment, he threw himself
    at the feet of Ignatius, begging his pardon for having too lightly
    believed such false reports; then rising, he publicly declared
    that Ignatius was a living saint, and had no other aim or desire
    than the salvation of souls, and was ready to suffer joyfully any
    infamous punishment. Such a reparation of honor gave the saint the
    highest reputation, and even the ancient and experienced doctors
    asked his advice in spiritual matters. Pegna himself was ever
    after his great admirer and friend, and appointed another scholar,
    who was more advanced in his studies, and a young man of great
    virtue and quick parts, to assist him in his exercises. This was
    Peter Faber, a Savoyard, a native of the diocess of Geneva, by
    whose help he finished his philosophy, and took the degree of
    master of arts with great applause, after a course of three years
    and a half, according to the custom of the times. After this,
    Ignatius began his divinity at the Dominicans.</p>
  <p>
    Peter Faber had from his childhood made a vow of chastity, which
    he had always most faithfully kept, yet was troubled with violent
    temptations, from which the most rigorous fasts did not deliver
    him. He was also tempted to vain-glory, and labored under great
    anxiety and scruples about these temptations, which he at length
    disclosed to Ignatius his holy pupil, whose skilful and heavenly
    advice was a healing balsam to his soul. The saint at last
    prescribed him a course of his spiritual exercises, and taught him
    the practices of meditation, of the particular examination, and
    other means of perfection, conducting him through all the paths of
    an interior life. St.&nbsp;Francis Xavier, a young master of
    philosophy, full of the vanity of the schools, was his next
    conquest. St.&nbsp;Ignatius made him sensible that all mortal
    glory is emptiness; only that which is eternal deserving our
    regard. He converted many abandoned sinners. When a young man,
    engaged in a criminal commerce with a woman of the city, was proof
    against his exhortations, Ignatius stood in a frozen pond by the
    way side up to the neck, and as he passed by in the night, cried
    out to him, “Whither are you going? Do not you hear the thunder of
    divine justice over your head, ready to break upon you? Go then;
    satisfy your brutish passion; here I&nbsp;will suffer for you, to
    appease heaven.” The lewd young man, at first affrighted, then
    confounded, returned back, and changed his life. By the like pious
    stratagems the saint recovered many other souls from the abysses
    into which they were fallen. He often served the sick in the
    hospitals; and one day finding a repugnance to touch the ulcers of
    one sick of a contagious distemper, to overcome himself he not
    only dressed his sores, but put his hand from them to his mouth,
    saying, “Since thou art afraid for one part, thy whole body shall
    take its share.” From that time he felt no natural repugnance in
    such actions.</p>
  <p>
    James Laynez, of Almazan, twenty-one years of age; Alphonsus
    Salmeron, only eighteen; and Nicholas Alphonso, surnamed
    Bobadilla, from the place of his birth, near Valencia, all
    Spaniards of great parts, at that time students in divinity at
    Paris, associated themselves to the saint in his pious exercises.
    Simon Rodriguez, a Portuguese, joined them. These fervent
    students, moved by the pressing instances and exhortations of
    Ignatius, made all together a vow to renounce the world, to go to
    preach the gospel in Palestine, or if they could not go thither
    within a year after they had finished their studies, to offer
    themselves to his holiness to be employed in the service of God in
    what manner he should judge best. They fixed for the end of all
    their studies the 25th day of January in&nbsp;1537, and pronounced
    this vow aloud, in the holy subterraneous chapel at Montmartre,
    after they had all received the holy communion from Peter Faber,
    who had been lately ordained priest. This was done on the feast of
    the Assumption of our Lady, in&nbsp;1534. Ignatius continued
    frequent conferences, and joint exercises, to animate his
    companions in their good purposes; but soon after was ordered by
    the physicians to try his native air, for the cure of a lingering
    indisposition. He left Paris in the beginning of the
    year&nbsp;1535, and was most honorably and joyfully received in
    Guipuscoa by his eldest brother Garcias, and his nephews, and by
    all the clergy in processions. He refused to go to the castle of
    Loyola, taking up his quarters in the hospital of Azpetia. The
    sight of the places where he had led a worldly life excited in him
    the deepest sentiments of compunction, and he chastised his body
    with a rough hair shirt, iron chains, disciplines, watching and
    prayer. He recovered his health in a short time, and catechised
    and instructed the poor with incredible fruit. Ignatius, in his
    childhood, had with some companions robbed an orchard, for which
    another man had been condemned to pay the damages. In the first
    discourse he made he accused himself publicly of this fact, and
    calling the poor man, who was present, declared that he had been
    falsely accused, and for reparation gave him two farms which
    belonged to him, begging his pardon before all the people, adding
    that this was one of the reasons of his journey thither.</p>
  <p>
    In the meantime, three others, all doctors in divinity, by the
    exhortations of Faber, joined the saint’s companions in Paris.
    Claudius le Jay, a Savoyard, John Codure, a native of Dauphiné,
    and Pasquier Brouet, of Picardy; so that with Ignatius they were
    now ten in number. The holy founder, after a tedious and dangerous
    journey both by sea and land, arrived at Venice about the end of
    the year&nbsp;1536, and his nine companions from Paris met him
    there on the 8th of January,&nbsp;1537; they employed themselves
    in the hospitals, but all except Ignatius went to Rome, where pope
    Paul&nbsp;III. received them graciously, and granted them an
    indult, that those who were not priests might receive holy orders
    from what bishop they pleased. They were accordingly ordained at
    Venice by the bishop of Arbe. Ignatius was one of this number.
    After their ordination they retired into a cottage near Vicenza,
    to prepare themselves in solitude by fasting and prayer for the
    holy ministry of the altar. The rest said their first masses in
    September and October, but Ignatius deferred his from month to
    month till Christmas day, overflowing in his retirement with
    heavenly consolations, and in danger of losing his sight through
    the abundance of his tears. Thus he employed a whole year in
    preparing himself to offer that adorable sacrifice. After this
    they dispersed themselves into several places about Verona and
    Vicenza, preaching penance to the people, and living on a little
    bread which they begged. The emperor and the Venetians having
    declared war against the Turks, their pilgrimage into Palestine
    was rendered impracticable. The year therefore being elapsed,
    Ignatius, Faber, and Laynez went to Rome, threw themselves at his
    Holiness’s feet and offered themselves to whatever work he should
    judge best to employ them in. St.&nbsp;Ignatius told his
    companions at Vicenza, that if any one asked what their institute
    was, they might answer, “the Society of Jesus;” because they were
    united to fight against heresies and vice under the standard of
    Christ. In his road from Vicenza to Rome, praying in a little
    chapel between Sienna and Rome, he, in an ecstasy, seemed to see
    the eternal Father, who affectionately commended him to his Son.
    <a id="c31_1d"> </a>Jesus Christ appeared at the same time also
    shining with an unspeakable light, but loaded with a heavy cross,
    and sweetly said to Ignatius,—“I&nbsp;will be favorable to you at
    Rome.”<a
      href="#fn_350"
      class="anchor">350</a>
    This St.&nbsp;Ignatius disclosed to F.&nbsp;Laynez, in a transport
    when he came out of the chapel; and F.&nbsp;Laynez, when he was
    general, related it to all the fathers in Rome in a domestic
    conference, at which F. Ribadeneira, who records it, was present.
    The same was attested by others to whom the saint had discovered
    this signal favor. Pope Paul&nbsp;III. accordingly received them
    graciously; and appointed Faber, called in French Le Fevre, to
    teach in the Sapienza at Rome scholastic divinity, and Laynez to
    explain the holy scripture; whilst Ignatius labored, by means of
    his spiritual exercises and instructions, to reform the manners of
    the people.</p>
  <p>
    The holy founder, with a view to perpetuate the work of God,
    called to Rome all his companions, and proposed to them his design
    and motives of forming themselves into a religious Order. After
    recommending the matter to God by fasting and prayer, all agreed
    in the proposal, and resolved, first, besides the vows of poverty
    and chastity already made by them, to add a third of perpetual
    obedience, the more perfectly to conform themselves to the Son of
    God who was obedient even to death; and to establish a general
    whom all, by their vow, should be bound to obey, who should be
    perpetual, and his authority absolute, subject entirely to the
    pope, but not liable to be restrained by chapters. He likewise
    determined to prescribe a fourth vow of going wherever the pope
    should send them for the salvation of souls, and even without
    money, if it should so please him; also that the professed Jesuits
    should possess no real estates or revenues, either in particular,
    or in common; but that colleges might enjoy revenues and rents for
    the maintenance of students of the Order. In the meanwhile Govea,
    principal of the college of St.&nbsp;Barbara at Paris, had
    recommended the Jesuits to the king of Portugal as proper
    missionaries for the conversion of the Indies, and that prince
    asked of Ignatius six laborers for that purpose. The founder
    having only ten, could send him no more than two, Simon Rodriguez,
    who remained in Portugal, and Xavier, afterward the apostle of the
    Indies. The three cardinals appointed by the pope to examine the
    affair of this new Order, at first opposed it, thinking religious
    Orders already too much multiplied, but changed their opinions on
    a sudden, and pope Paul&nbsp;III. approved it under the title of
    “The Society of Jesus,” by a bull, dated the 27th of
    September,&nbsp;1540. Ignatius was chosen the first general, but
    only acquiesced in obedience to his confessor. He entered upon his
    office on Easter-day,&nbsp;1541, and the members all made their
    religious vows, according to the bull of their institution.</p>
  <p>
    Ignatius then set himself to write constitutions or rules for his
    Society, in which he lays down its end to be, in the first place,
    the sanctification of their own souls by joining together the
    active and the contemplative life; for nothing so much qualifies a
    minister of God to save others as the sanctification of his own
    soul in the first place; secondly, to labor for the salvation and
    perfection of their neighbor, and this, first, by catechising the
    ignorant (which work is the basis and ground of religion and
    virtue, and though mean and humble, is the most necessary and
    indispensable duty of every pastor),<a id="c31_1e"> </a>secondly,
    by the instruction of youth<a
      href="#fn_351"
      class="anchor">351</a>
    in piety and learning (upon which the reformation of the world
    principally depends); and thirdly, by the direction of
    consciences, missions, and the like.<a
      href="#fn_352"
      class="anchor">352</a></p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius would have the office of general to be perpetual
    or for life, being persuaded this would better command the respect
    of inferiors, and more easily enable him to undertake and carry on
    great enterprises for the glory of God, which require a
    considerable time to have them well executed. Nevertheless, he
    often strenuously endeavored to resign that dignity, but was never
    able to compass it; and at length the pope forbade him any more to
    attempt it. He had no sooner taken that charge upon him than he
    went into the kitchen, and served as a scullion under the cook,
    and he continued for forty-six days to catechise poor children in
    the church of the Society. By preaching he gained such an
    ascendant over the hearts of the people as produced many wonderful
    conversions. Among the pious establishments which he made at Rome,
    he founded a house for the reception of Jews who should be
    converted, during the time of their instruction, and another for
    the reception and maintenance of lewd women who should be desirous
    to enter upon virtuous courses, yet were not called to a religious
    state among the Magdalens or penitents. When one told him that the
    conversion of such sinners is seldom sincere, he answered: “To
    prevent only one sin would be a great happiness, though it cost me
    ever so great pains.” He procured two houses to be erected at Rome
    for the relief of poor orphans of both sexes, and another for the
    maintenance of young women whose poverty might expose their virtue
    to danger. The heart of this blessed man so burned with charity,
    that he was continually thinking and speaking of what might most
    contribute to promote the divine honor and the sanctification of
    souls; and he did wonders by the zealous fathers of his Society in
    all parts of the globe. He was entreated by many princes and
    cities of Italy, Spain, Germany, and the Low-Countries to afford
    them some of his laborers. Under the auspicious protection of
    John&nbsp;III. king of Portugal, he sent St.&nbsp;Francis Xavier
    into the East-Indies, where he gained a new world to the faith of
    Christ. He sent John Nugnez and Lewis Gonzales into the kingdoms
    of Fez and Morocco to instruct and assist the Christian slaves;
    in&nbsp;1547, four others to Congo in Africa; in&nbsp;1555,
    thirteen into Abyssinia, among whom John Nugnez was nominated by
    pope Julius&nbsp;III. patriarch of Ethiopia, and two others,
    bishops; lastly, others into the Portuguese settlements in South
    America.</p>
  <p>
    Pope Paul&nbsp;III. commissioned the fathers James Laynez and
    Alphonsus Salmeron to assist, in quality of his theologians, at
    the council of Trent. Before their departure, St.&nbsp;Ignatius,
    among other instructions, gave them a charge in all disputations
    to be careful above all things, to preserve modesty and humility,
    and to shun all confidence, contentiousness, or empty display of
    learning. F.&nbsp;Claudius Le Jay appeared in the same council as
    theologian of cardinal Otho, bishop of Ausberg. Many of the first
    disciples of St.&nbsp;Ignatius distinguished themselves in divers
    kingdoms of Europe, but none with greater reputation, both for
    learning and piety, than<a id="c31_1f"> </a>Peter Canisius, who
    was a native of Nimeguen, in the Low Countries, and having with
    wonderful success employed his zealous labors at Ingolstadt and in
    several other parts of Germany, and in Bohemia, died in the odor
    of sanctity, at Fribourg, in&nbsp;1597, seventy-seven years old.<a
      href="#fn_353"
      class="anchor">353</a>
    Whilst F.&nbsp;Claudius Le Jay was at Trent, Ferdinand, king of
    the Romans, nominated him bishop of Trieste. The good father
    seemed ready to die of grief at this news, and wrote to
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius, humbly requesting him to put some bar to this
    promotion. The holy founder was himself alarmed, and by a pressing
    letter to the king, prevailed upon him not to do what would be an
    irreparable prejudice to his young Society. He urged to the pope
    and sacred college many reasons why he desired that all the
    fathers of his Society should be excluded from all ecclesiastical
    dignities, alleging that this would be a means more easily to
    preserve among them a spirit of humility and poverty, which is the
    very soul and perfection of their state; and that, being
    missionaries, it was more advantageous to the Church that they
    should remain such, always ready to fly from pole to pole, as the
    public necessities should require. The pope being satisfied with
    his reasons, the saint obliged all professed Jesuits to bind
    themselves by a simple vow never to seek prelatures, and to refuse
    them when offered, unless compelled by a precept of the pope to
    accept them.</p>
  <p id="c31_1g">
    In&nbsp;1546 the Jesuits first opened their schools in Europe, in
    the college which St.&nbsp;Francis Borgia had erected for them at
    Gandia, with the privileges of an university.<a
      href="#fn_354"
      class="anchor">354</a>
    The seminary of Goa in Asia, which had been erected some years
    before for the Indian missions, was committed to the Jesuits,
    under the direction of St.&nbsp;Francis Xavier, the preceding
    year. King John also founded for them, in&nbsp;1546, a noble
    college at Coïmbra, the second which they had in Europe.
    F.&nbsp;Simon Rodriguez directed this establishment, and many
    others in Portugal, Spain, and Brazil, and died at Lisbon in the
    highest reputation for sanctity and learning in&nbsp;1579. Among
    the rules which St.&nbsp;Ignatius gave to the masters, he
    principally inculcated the lessons of humility, modesty, and
    devotion; he prescribed that all their scholars should hear mass
    every day, go to confession every month, and always begin their
    studies by prayer; that their masters should take every fit
    occasion to inspire them with the love of heavenly things; and
    that by daily meditation, self-examinations, pious reading,
    retreat, and the constant exercise of the divine presence, they
    should nourish in their own souls a fervent spirit of prayer,
    which without the utmost care is extinguished by a dry course of
    studies and school disputations; and with it is destroyed the very
    soul of a religious or spiritual life. He recommended nothing more
    earnestly, both to professors and scholars, than that they should
    dedicate all their labors, with the greatest fervor, to the
    greater glory of God, which intention will make studies equal to
    prayer. He treated very harshly all those whom learning rendered
    self-conceited or less devout; and removed all those masters who
    discovered any fondness for singular opinions. It is incredible
    with what attention and industry he promoted emulation and every
    means that could be a spur to scholars. He required that copies of
    some of the principal literary performances should be sent from
    all the colleges to Rome, where he had them examined before him,
    that he might better judge of the progress both of masters and
    scholars.</p>
  <p>
    He encouraged every branch of the sciences, and would have the
    fathers in his Society applied to those functions, whether in
    teaching, preaching, or the missions, for which God seemed chiefly
    to qualify and destine them by their genius, talents, and
    particular graces; yet so that no one should neglect the duties
    either of assiduous prayer and an interior life, or of instructing
    and catechising others. He recommended to them all, especially to
    the masters of novices, &amp;c., to read diligently the
    conferences, lives, and writings of the fathers of the desert, and
    other pious ascetics, in order to learn their spirit. With what
    success many among them did this, appears from the Practice of
    Christian Perfection, compiled by F.&nbsp;Alphonsus Rodrigues, one
    of the most eminent persons whom our saint had admitted into his
    Society.<a id="c31_1h"> </a>In this excellent work he gathered and
    digested, in a clear and easy method, the most admirable maxims
    and lessons of the ancient monks; and having many years trained
    up, according to them, the novices of his Order in Spain, died
    holily in the year&nbsp;1616, the ninetieth of his age.<a
      href="#fn_355"
      class="anchor">355</a>
    We have other eminent instances of this holy spirit and science
    among the primitive disciples of St.&nbsp;Ignatius, in the works
    of F.&nbsp;Lewis de Ponte or Puente, who died in 1624, and whose
    canonization has been often desired by the kings of Spain; in
    those of F.&nbsp;Alvarez de Paz, who died in Peru in&nbsp;1620;
    and in the writings and life of F.&nbsp;Baltassar Alvarez, who
    died in Spain in 1580, in the odor of sanctity.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Francis Borgia, in&nbsp;1551, gave a considerable sum
    towards building the Roman college for the Jesuits. Pope
    Julius&nbsp;III. contributed largely to it; Paul&nbsp;IV.,
    in&nbsp;1555, founded it for perpetuity with great munificence;
    afterward Gregory&nbsp;XIII. much augmented its buildings and
    revenues. St.&nbsp;Ignatius, intending to make this the model of
    all his other colleges, neglected nothing to render it complete,
    and took care that it should be supplied with the ablest masters
    in all the sciences, and with all possible helps for the
    advancement of literature.<a id="c31_1i"> </a>He made it a strict
    rule in the Society, that every one should study to speak
    correctly the language of the country where he lives;<a
      href="#fn_356"
      class="anchor">356</a>
    for, without being perfect in the vulgar tongue, no one can be
    qualified to preach or perform many other functions with profit.
    On this account he established in the Roman college daily lessons
    in the Italian tongue, and he carefully studied that language, and
    appointed others to put him in mind of all the faults which he
    should commit in speaking. St.&nbsp;Ignatius also directed the
    foundation of the German college in Rome made by Julius&nbsp;III.
    but afterwards finished by Gregory&nbsp;XIII. He often met with
    violent persecutions, but overcame them by meekness and patience.
    When the French king Henry&nbsp;II. gave the Society letters
    patent to settle in France, the parliament of Paris made the most
    outrageous remonstrances, and the faculty of Sorbon, though not
    without opposition, passed a virulent decree against it. The other
    fathers at Rome thought it necessary to answer these censures; but
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius would have nothing printed or written in their
    defence, saying, that it was better to commit their cause to God,
    and that the slanders raised against them would fall of
    themselves; and so it happened. Indeed the storm was too violent
    to last. Upon other occasions the saint modestly defended his
    institute against slanderers.</p>
  <p>
    The prudence and charity of the saint in his conduct towards his
    religious, won him all their hearts. His commands seemed rather
    entreaties. The address with which he accommodated himself to
    every one’s particular genius, and the mildness with which he
    tempered his reproofs, gave to his reprehensions a sweetness which
    gained the affections whilst it corrected a fault. Thus chiding
    one for his too little guard over his eyes, he said to him, with
    tenderness: “I&nbsp;have often admired the modesty of your
    deportment, yet observe that unguarded glances often escape you.”
    When another had fixed his eye steadfastly upon him a long time,
    the saint enjoined him to make the government of his eye the
    subject of his particular examination, and to say every day a
    short prayer for fifteen months. He extremely recommended a strict
    modesty in the whole exterior as the index of the interior, and a
    means absolutely necessary for the regulating of it, and the
    government of the senses and passions. He always showed the
    affection of the most tender parent towards all his brethren,
    especially towards the sick, for whom he was solicitous to procure
    every spiritual and even temporal succor and comfort, which it was
    his great delight to give them himself. The most perfect obedience
    and self-denial were the two first lessons which he inculcated to
    his novices, whom he told at the door as they entered, that they
    must leave behind them all self-will and private judgment. In his
    famous letter to the Portuguese Jesuits, On the Virtue of
    Obedience, he says, this alone bringeth forth and nourisheth all
    other virtues; and calls it the peculiar virtue, and
    distinguishing mark and characteristic of his Society, in which,
    if any member suffer himself to be outdone by those of other
    Orders in fasting or watching, that he must yield to none in
    obedience. He adds, true obedience must reach the understanding as
    well as the will, and never suffer a person even secretly to
    complain of, or censure the precept of a superior, whom he must
    always consider as vested with the authority of Jesus Christ over
    him. He says, it is not a less fault to break the laws of
    obedience in watching than in sleeping, in laboring than in doing
    nothing.</p>
  <p>
    When F.&nbsp;Araos, whose spiritual labors were very successful in
    the court of Spain, seemed to seek the conversation of the great
    ones of the world, upon pretence of conciliating their favor to
    his ministry, St.&nbsp;Ignatius sent him a sharp reprimand,
    telling him that the necessary authority for the ministers of the
    word of God, is to be gained only by a spirit of recollection, and
    the exercises of Christian humility; for the loss of everything is
    to be feared in an intercourse with the great ones of the world.
    He used to say, that prosperity caused in him more fear than joy,
    that when persecution ceased he should be in apprehension lest the
    Society should somewhat relax in the observance of its regular
    discipline; that good fortune is never to be trusted, and that we
    have most to fear when things go according to our desires. He made
    a most severe regulation, that in the Society no one should ever
    visit women, even of the highest quality, alone; and that when
    they discoursed with them, or heard their confessions, this should
    be so ordered, that the companion might see all that passed,
    without hearing what ought to be secret, this being a means to
    prevent the possibility of evil suspicions or slanders. In the
    assigning the employments of those under his charge, he had
    usually a regard to their inclinations, though he always required
    that, on their parts, they should be wholly indifferent and
    disposed cheerfully to accept and discharge any.</p>
  <p>
    Notwithstanding the fatigue and constant application which the
    establishment of his Order in all parts of the world, and so many
    other great enterprises undertaken to promote the glory of God,
    required, he was all on fire with an excess of charity, and a
    restless desire of gaining souls to God, and wearied himself out
    in the service of his neighbor, always laboring to extirpate vice,
    and to promote virtue in all, and set on foot several practices
    which might conduce to the divine service and the salvation of
    men. It is not to be believed how many and how great affairs this
    blessed man was able to go through, and with what courage and
    spirit he bore so continual a burden, and this with so weak health
    and infirm body. But he was assisted by the powerful hand of our
    Lord, that furnished him with strength for all his labors; so that
    he then appeared strongest and most courageous, when he was weary,
    sickly, and unprovided of human and natural helps; for, in his
    infirmity, the power of God manifested itself, and the saint
    seemed to support the weakness of his body with the vigor of his
    soul. This interior strength he chiefly maintained by an eminent
    spirit of prayer, and the constant and closest union of his soul
    with God. For he was favored with an extraordinary grace of
    devotion, which he, out of humility, thought God had given him out
    of compassion for his weakness and misery, which he said was
    greater than that of any other. In saying the holy mass, and
    reciting the divine office, the abundance of heavenly delights
    which God poured into his soul, was often so great, and made such
    showers of tears stream from his eyes, that he was obliged to stop
    in a manner at every word, sometimes to make a considerable
    interruption whilst he gave vent to his tears. It was once feared,
    lest his continual effusion of tears should hurt his eye-sight. At
    other times, though his eyes were dry at his devotion, and the
    sluices of his tears were shut up, yet their influence and effect
    was not wanting; for his spirit was still watered with heavenly
    dew, and the divine illustrations ceased not to flow copiously
    into his soul.</p>
  <p>
    In matters of concern, though reasons were ever so convincing and
    evident, he never took any resolution before he had consulted God
    by prayer. He let not an hour pass in the day without recollecting
    himself interiorly, and examining his conscience, for this purpose
    banishing for a while all other thoughts. He never applied his
    mind so much to exterior affairs as to lose the sweet relish of
    interior devotion. He had God always and in all things present to
    his mind. Every object served him for a book, wherein he read the
    divine perfections, and by that means raised his heart to his
    Creator. He recommended this manner of prayer to every one,
    especially to those who are employed in spiritual functions for
    the help of their neighbor. Before he betook himself to public or
    private prayer, he prepared his soul with great fervor, and
    entering into the oratory of his heart, enkindled his affections,
    so that this appeared in his countenance, and he seemed to be all
    on fire, as we ourselves frequently observed, says Ribadeneira.
    The saint being once asked by F.&nbsp;Lainez what manner of prayer
    he used, gave this answer, that in matters concerning Almighty God
    he behaved himself rather passively than actively. He prayed
    sometimes standing, and profoundly adored the majesty of God
    present to his soul; he often bowed his body low, and most
    frequently prayed on his knees. No sooner had he recollected his
    mind in God, but his countenance put on an air which appeared
    altogether heavenly, and often streams of tears fell sweetly from
    his eyes.</p>
  <p>
    He prescribed to the priests of his Order to be about half an hour
    at the altar in saying mass, to avoid on one side the least
    appearance of indecent hurry and precipitation in that tremendous
    sacrifice; and, on the other, not to be tedious to the people by
    unseasonably indulging their private devotion. Nevertheless, he
    was himself about an hour in saying mass, to excuse which he
    alleged the plea of necessity, being often obliged to make pauses
    through an irresistible tenderness of devotion. After mass he
    spent two hours in private prayer, during which time no one was
    admitted to speak to him except on some pressing necessity.
    F.&nbsp;Louis Gonzales, who for some time governed the college
    under him, says, “As often as I&nbsp;went to him at that time,
    which necessity frequently obliged me to do, I&nbsp;always saw his
    face shining with an air so bright and heavenly, that, quite
    forgetting myself, I&nbsp;stood astonished in contemplating him.
    Nor was his countenance like that of many devout men in whom
    I&nbsp;have admired a wonderful serenity at their prayers, but it
    breathed something quite unusual, and, as it were, divine.” On
    other occasions the like was remarked in him; on which account
    F.&nbsp;Lainez compared him to Moses when he came from conversing
    with God. Nicholas Lanoy testified, that he one day saw a fire
    flame on his head whilst he was saying mass. Saint Philip Neri,
    who often visited St.&nbsp;Ignatius, used to assure his friends
    that he had seen his face shining with bright rays of light.<a
    id="c31_1j"> </a>As F.&nbsp;Antony Galloni, his disciple and
    confidant in all his concerns, and Marcellus Vitelleschi declared
    they had often heard from his own mouth; of which cardinal
    Taurusius, archbishop of Sienna, published an authentic
    certificate.<a
      href="#fn_357"
      class="anchor">357</a>
    John Petronius, a famous physician in Rome, declared publicly
    that, when sick, he once saw his own chamber, which was then very
    dark, by reason of the windows being shut, filled with a dazzling
    light from such rays upon the blessed man’s coming into it. Isabel
    Rosella, John Pascal, and several other persons testified, that
    they had sometimes beheld his countenance at prayer sparkling with
    radiant beams of light, the abundant consolations which
    replenished his soul redounding on his body. John Pascal added,
    that he had seen him in prayer raised more than a foot above the
    ground, and heard him say at the same time, “O&nbsp;my God!
    O&nbsp;my Lord! O&nbsp;that men knew thee!” The saint was often
    favored, amid the tears and fervor of his devotion, with wonderful
    raptures, visions, and revelations; and some of these visions and
    other supernatural favors St.&nbsp;Ignatius mentioned himself in
    short notes which he wrote, and which were found in his own hand
    after his death,<a id="c31_1k"> </a>some of which notes are
    published by F.&nbsp;Bartoli.<a
      href="#fn_358"
      class="anchor">358</a>
    Others are mentioned by Ribadeneira, who inserted in the saint’s
    life, as he declares, only what himself had seen, or had heard
    from his mouth, or from persons of unquestionable authority, and
    whose life of his holy founder, by the order of Saint Francis
    Borgia, was carefully examined and approved by the principal
    persons then living who had frequently conversed with the saint,
    as Salmeron, Bobadilla, Polancus, who had been the saint’s
    secretary, Natalis,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
  <p>
    If the spirit of prayer was that virtue by which our saint was
    admitted to the familiar intercourse with God, was the key which
    unlocked to him the treasure of all other virtues and graces, and
    was the continual comfort, support, and light of his soul, and the
    constant advancement of its supernatural life in his mortal
    pilgrimage, this spirit was itself founded in the most perfect
    self-denial. The Holy Ghost never communicates himself, by the
    infusion of this grace, but to a heart that is entirely dead to
    itself and its passions, and crucified to the world. This
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius understood so well, that hearing another once
    say, that a certain person was endowed with a great gift of
    contemplation, and was eminently a man of prayer, he corrected the
    expression, saying, “call him rather a man of the most perfect
    self-denial;” because the spirit of grace and prayer requires a
    perfect purity and disengagement from all inordinate affections,
    and a heart empty of itself. This victory over himself the saint
    obtained by an habitual practice of the exterior mortification of
    his senses; and by that perfect patience, resignation, and
    confidence in God, and constancy with which he bore the most
    severe interior and exterior trials. To complete the most
    essential interior mortification of his will and passions, he
    added the practice of an unlimited obedience to his directors and
    superiors, and of the most profound and sincere humility. Even
    when broken with age and infirmities, he said, that should his
    Holiness command it, he would with joy go on board the first ship
    he could find; and if he were so ordered, though it had neither
    sails nor rudder, and without any warning, would immediately set
    out for any part of the globe. It was his perpetual lesson to his
    novices,—“Sacrifice your will and judgment by obedience. Whatever
    you do without the consent of your spiritual guide will be imputed
    to wilfulness, not to virtue, though you were to exhaust your
    bodies by labors or austerities.”</p>
  <p>
    Humility is the sister virtue of obedience, the foundation of a
    spiritual life, and the distinguishing mark or characteristic of
    all the saints. This virtue St.&nbsp;Ignatius embraced with the
    utmost ardor, from his first entering upon a spiritual course of
    life. He went a long time in old tattered rags, and lived in
    hospitals, despised, affronted, and persecuted; this he desired,
    and in it he found his great joy and satisfaction. He ever
    retained this affection for humiliations, out of a sincere
    contempt of himself; for acknowledging himself a sinner, he was
    thoroughly persuaded that contempt and injuries from all
    creatures, as instruments of the divine justice, were his due, and
    that he was most unworthy of all comforts, favor, or regard.
    Nothing but charity and zeal to procure his neighbor’s good
    restrained him from doing ridiculous things on purpose to be
    laughed at by all; and he always practised such humiliations as
    were consistent with prudence and his other duties. All his
    actions and whatever belonged to him, breathed an air of sincere
    humility. His apparel was poor, though clean; his bed was very
    mean, and his diet coarse, and so temperate, that it was a
    perpetual abstinence. He employed himself often most cheerfully in
    the meanest offices about the house, as in making beds, and in
    cleansing the chambers of the sick. It was his great study to
    conceal his virtues, and nothing was more admirable in his life
    than the address with which he covered his most heroic actions
    under the veil of humility. Though he was superior, he frequently
    submitted to inferiors with wonderful meekness and humility, when
    he could do it without prejudice to his authority. In things of
    which he was not certain, he readily acquiesced in the judgment of
    others; and was a great enemy to all positiveness, and to the use
    of superlatives in discourse. He received rebukes from any one
    with cheerfulness and thanks. If in his presence anything was said
    that redounded to his praise, he showed an extreme confusion,
    which was usually accompanied with many tears. He was seldom heard
    to speak of himself, and never but on very pressing occasions.
    Though visions, revelations, and the like favors were frequently
    vouchsafed him, he scarce ever mentioned such things; but all his
    discourse was of humility, charity, patience, divine zeal, prayer,
    mortification, and other such virtues, of which we are to make the
    greatest account, and by which alone men become saints and friends
    of God. Ribadeneira heard him say, that every one in the house was
    to him an example of virtue, and that he was not scandalized at
    any one besides himself. It was his usual saying, that he did not
    think there was a man in the world, that on one side received from
    God so great and continual favors, and yet on the other side was
    so ungrateful, and so slothful in his service as himself. It was
    his desire that, after his death, his body might be thrown upon
    some dunghill, in punishment of the sins he had committed by
    pampering it. The chief reasons why he would have his Order called
    The Society of Jesus, were lest his name should be given it, and
    that his followers might be known by their love and zeal for their
    Redeemer. As often as he spoke of his Order, he called it, This
    least Society; for he would have his children to look upon
    themselves as the last and least of all persons in the Church.</p>
  <p>
    From the perfect mortification of all his passions and inordinate
    affections resulted an admirable peace and evenness of mind which
    nothing seemed able ever to disturb or ruffle. His contempt of the
    world appeared by the disinterestedness with which he rejected
    legacies and presents whenever they might give occasion to
    complaints. When he looked up towards the heavens, he used
    feelingly to repeat, “How contemptible doth earth appear when
    I&nbsp;behold the heavens!” Charity, or the most ardent and pure
    love of God, was the most conspicuous, and the crown of all his
    other virtues. He had often in his mouth these words, which he
    took for his motto or device, “To the greater glory of God,”
    referring to this end, with all his strength, himself, his
    Society, and all his actions, in which he always chose that which
    appeared to him the most perfect. He often said to God, “Lord,
    what do I&nbsp;desire, or what can I&nbsp;desire besides thee?”
    True love is never idle; and always to labor, to promote God’s
    honor, or to suffer for his sake, was this saint’s greatest
    pleasure. He said, that no created thing can bring to a soul such
    solid joy and comfort as to suffer for Christ. Being asked what
    was the most certain and the shortest way to perfection, he
    answered, “To endure for the love of Christ many and grievous
    afflictions. Ask this grace of our Lord: on whomsoever he
    bestoweth it, he does him many other signal favors, that always
    attend this grace.” Out of this burning love of God, he most
    ardently desired the separation of his soul from his mortal body,
    when it should be God’s will; and, when he thought of death, he
    could not refrain from tears of joy, because he should then see
    his loving Redeemer; and, beholding God face to face, should love
    and praise him eternally, without let, abatement, or
    intermission.</p>
  <p>
    From this same love of God sprang his ardent thirst for the
    salvation of men, for which he undertook so many and so great
    things, and to which he devoted his watchings, prayers, tears, and
    labors. When he dismissed any missionaries to preach the word of
    God, he usually said to them, “Go, brethren, inflame the world,
    spread about that fire which Jesus Christ came to kindle on
    earth.” To gain others to Christ he, with admirable address, made
    himself all to all, going in at <i>their</i> door, and coming out
    at <i>his own</i>. He received sincere penitents with the greatest
    sweetness and condescension, so as often to take upon himself part
    of their penance. When a brother, growing weary of the yoke of
    Christ, had determined to leave the Society, St.&nbsp;Ignatius by
    his remonstrances made such an impression upon his heart, that
    falling at the feet of the general, he offered to undergo whatever
    punishment he would impose upon him. To which the saint replied,
    “One part of your penance shall be, that you never repent more of
    having served God. For the other part, I&nbsp;take it upon myself,
    and will discharge it for you.” He endeavored to bring all his
    penitents to make, without reserve, the perfect sacrifice of
    themselves to God, telling them, that it is not to be expressed
    what precious treasures God reserves for, and with what effusion
    he communicates himself to, those who give themselves to him with
    their whole heart. He proposed to them for their model this
    prayer, which he used often to recite,—“Receive, O&nbsp;Lord, all
    my liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my whole will. You
    have given me all that I&nbsp;have, all that I&nbsp;possess, and
    I&nbsp;surrender all to your divine will, that you dispose of me.
    Give me only your love, and your grace. With this I&nbsp;am rich
    enough, and I&nbsp;have no more to ask.”</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius was general of the Society fifteen years, three
    months, and nine days; but was in the end so worn out with
    infirmities, that he procured that the Society should choose him
    an assistant in that office. This was F.&nbsp;Jerom Nadal. After
    which, the saint reserved to himself only the care of the sick,
    and spent his time in continual prayer, and in preparing himself
    for death. By way of his last will and testament, he dictated
    certain holy maxims concerning the obligation and conditions of
    religious obedience, which he bequeathed to his brethren of the
    Society. The saint, on the day before he died, charged
    F.&nbsp;Polancus to beg his Holiness’s blessing for him at the
    article of death, though others at that time did not think it so
    near. The next morning having lifted up his eyes and hands to
    heaven, and pronouncing, both with his tongue and heart, the sweet
    name of Jesus with a serene countenance, he calmly gave up his
    happy soul into the hands of his Creator on the last day of July,
    in the year&nbsp;1556, the sixty-fifth of his age, the
    thirty-fifth after his conversion, and the sixteenth after his
    confirmation of the Society.<a id="c31_1l"> </a>The people
    esteemed him a saint both living and after his death; and the
    opinion of his sanctity was confirmed by many miracles.<a
      href="#fn_359"
      class="anchor">359</a>
    He saw his Society in very few years divided into twelve
    provinces, with above one hundred colleges, and spread over almost
    the whole world. In&nbsp;1626, it contained thirty-six provinces,
    and in them eight hundred houses, and fifteen thousand Jesuits,
    since which time it is much increased. St.&nbsp;Ignatius’s body
    was buried first in the little church of the Jesuits, dedicated in
    honor of the blessed Virgin in Rome. When cardinal Alexander
    Farnesius had built the stately church of the professed house
    called Il Giesu, it was translated thither in&nbsp;1587; and,
    in&nbsp;1637, was laid under the altar of the chapel, which bears
    his name. This church is one of the most magnificent piles of
    building in the world next to the Vatican, and is not less admired
    for the elegance of the architecture than for its riches,
    consisting in costly beautiful ornaments of gold, silver, jewels,
    exquisite paintings, statues, and carving, and a great profusion
    of fine marble. Among the many chapels which it contains, those of
    the Blessed Virgin, of the Angels, of SS.&nbsp;Abundius and
    Abundantius, martyrs, of St.&nbsp;Francis Borgia, and of
    St.&nbsp;Ignatius, are the admiration of travellers, especially
    the last; in which the remains of the holy founder lie, in a rich
    silver shrine under the altar, exposed to view. The other
    glittering rich ornaments of this place seem almost to lose their
    lustre when the statue of the saint is uncovered. It is somewhat
    bigger than the life, because raised high. Its bright shining
    gold, silver, and sparkling diamonds, especially in the crown of
    glory over the head, dazzle the eye. In the professed house are
    shown the pictures of St.&nbsp;Ignatius and St.&nbsp;Philip Neri,
    taken from the life. St.&nbsp;Ignatius’s chamber is now a chapel,
    his study is another, in which prelates, and sometimes popes, come
    to say mass on the saint’s festival. He was beatified by
    Paul&nbsp;V. in&nbsp;1609, and canonized by Gregory&nbsp;XV.
    in&nbsp;1622, though the bull was only published the year
    following by Urban&nbsp;VIII.</p>
  <p>
    The example of the saints evinces that to disengage our affections
    from earthly things, and to converse much in heaven by the
    constant union of our hearts to God, is the short road to
    Christian perfection. Those who are employed in the active life,
    ought to learn the art of accompanying all their actions with a
    lively attention to the divine presence, as our guardian angels
    are faithful in discharging every duty of that external ministry
    which God hath committed to them, yet so as never to intermit
    their contemplation of the Godhead, and their incessant homages of
    praise and love, which are the uninterrupted employment of their
    happy state. Without this precaution, by the hurry of dry studies,
    and even the discharge of the sacred ministry itself, the spirit
    of piety and devotion is extinguished in the heart, and the more
    sacred functions are easily profaned.</p>

    ST.&nbsp;JOHN COLUMBINI,&nbsp;C.</h3>
  <p class="subhead">
    FOUNDER OF THE ORDER OF THE JESUATI.</p>
  <p>
    He was descended of one of the most ancient and noble families of
    Sienna; and being chosen first magistrate of that commonwealth,
    acquitted himself of all the duties of that charge with integrity
    and honor, and to the great satisfaction of his countrymen; but he
    was passionate, and his heart was strongly wedded to the world,
    and buried under the weight and hurry of its business, vanity, and
    ambition, so that he scarce seemed able to find leisure to
    breathe, or to think of eternity. One day, after being taken up
    the whole morning in deciding causes in his court, he came home,
    much fatigued, and not finding dinner ready, flew into a violent
    passion. His wife put a book of the Saints’ Lives into his hands;
    but he threw it on the ground. The next moment, being ashamed of
    his passion, he took it up again, and sitting down to read, fell
    on the life of St.&nbsp;Mary of Egypt. He read it with so much
    pleasure that he thought no more of his dinner; and insensibly
    found his heart pierced with compunction and remorse for his past
    sins and unthinking conduct, and entirely weaned from the
    world.</p>
  <p>
    From that moment he resolved to begin a new life; and, to expiate
    his offences, he embraced the most austere practices of penance.
    Resigning his public employs, he consecrated the greatest part of
    his estates to alms-deeds; and being sensible that the first
    sacrifice which God requires of a sinner is that of a contrite and
    humble heart, without which no other can be acceptable to him, he
    spent his time chiefly in prayers and tears. He sold his rich
    clothes and furniture, giving the money to the poor, that they
    might be intercessors in his behalf at the throne of mercy; he lay
    on two boards, watching great part of the night in prayer, and his
    house seemed converted into a hospital, so great was the number of
    the poor and sick that he caused to be brought thither, and
    attended. The whole country was astonished at so great a change,
    and so exemplary a penance. Francis Vincent joined him in this
    manner of life. They both ran the same course, and with equal
    paces. One day seeing a leper lying at the door of the great
    church, covered with blotches and ulcers, the saint carried him on
    his back through the public market-place; attending him both as
    his servant and physician, tenderly kissing his running sores one
    after another, till he had perfectly overcome the abhorrence which
    nature inspires in such actions, and continued his care of this
    patient till he was perfectly cured.</p>
  <p>
    St.&nbsp;John had one son and one daughter. The former God called
    to himself by death, and the latter consecrated herself to his
    divine service in a nunnery. St.&nbsp;John had before this, with
    his wife’s consent, made a vow of chastity; and after their
    children were thus disposed of, he sold his estate, and gave
    one-third of it to a hospital, and the other two-thirds to
    different churches and the poor. Having thus reduced himself to a
    state of poverty like that of the apostles, he gave himself up to
    serve the poor in the hospitals, and to the exercises of devotion
    and the most rigorous penance. Several others, moved by his
    example, became his faithful imitators and companions. They were
    solicitous to exhort the sick and poor to the sincere dispositions
    of repentance, and to fervor in the divine service; and the
    charity and disinterestedness with which they ministered to them
    corporal relief and comfort, gave great force to their zealous
    instructions. Out of their ardent love of our Redeemer, whom they
    considered and served in his afflicted members, they had his holy
    name so often, and with so great devotion and respect in their
    mouths, that the people gave them the name of Jesuats. That
    adorable name is repeated fifteen hundred times in the few letters
    which St.&nbsp;John wrote.<a id="c31_2a"> </a>The number of his
    disciples being increased to about seventy, he formed them into a
    religious Order, under the rule of St.&nbsp;Austin, and took
    St.&nbsp;Jerom for their patron.<a
      href="#fn_360"
      class="anchor">360</a>
    He addressed himself to pope Urban&nbsp;V. at Viterbo, who
    approved and confirmed his institute in&nbsp;1367, and granted to
    it most ample privileges. Such was the fervor of the first
    disciples of our saint, that almost all their names have been
    placed among the blessed. The holy founder fell sick soon after
    the approbation of his Order; and, having received the last
    sacraments, commending his soul into the hands of his Creator
    through the death of Christ, and in union with his recommendation
    of his divine soul to his Father on the cross, he happily expired
    on the 31st of July, in the year&nbsp;1367, the twelfth after his
    conversion, only thirty-seven days after his Order had been
    confirmed by Pope Urban&nbsp;V. See F.&nbsp;Cuper, the Bollandist,
    Julij, t.&nbsp;7, p.&nbsp;333, and Helyot, Hist. des Ord. Rel.

    SAINT HELEN OF SKOFDE IN&nbsp;SWEDEN,&nbsp;M.</h3>
  <p>
    She was a lady of quality in Westrogothia, whom Saint Sigfrid,
    apostle of that province in Sweden, who died in 1045, converted to
    the faith. She made a pilgrimage to Rome, and upon her return was
    martyred by her own relations about the year&nbsp;1160, at her own
    estate of Skofde or Scœude, in Westrogothia in Sweden. She was
    honored on the 31st of July, with extraordinary devotion in that
    country, and in the isle of Seland in Denmark, especially in the
    church which bears her name, where her body was kept in a rich
    shrine, eight miles from Copenhagen, near the sea, in which place
    there is a famous miraculous well still resorted to by the
    Lutherans, and called to this day St.&nbsp;Lene Kild, or
    St.&nbsp;Helen’s well. She was canonized by Alexander&nbsp;III.
    in&nbsp;1164, and her feast fixed on the 31st of July. See the

            The place of St.&nbsp;Rumold’s death is contested.
            According to certain Belgic and other Martyrologies, he
            was of the blood royal of Scotland (as Ireland was then
            called) and bishop of Dublin. This opinion is ably
            supported by F.&nbsp;Hu. Ward, an Irish Franciscan, a man
            well skilled in the antiquities of his country, in a work
            entitled Dissertatio Historica de Vita et Patria
            S.&nbsp;Rumoldi, Archiepiscopi Dubliniensis, published at
            Louvain in&nbsp;1662, in 4to. The learned pope
            Benedict&nbsp;XIV. seems to adjudge St.&nbsp;Rumold to
            Ireland, in his letter to the prelates of that kingdom
            dated the 1st of August,&nbsp;1741, wherein are the
            following words: “Quod si recensere voluerimus
            sanctissimos viros Columbanum, Kilianum, Virgilium,
            Rumoldum, Gallum, aliosque plures qui ex Hibernia in alias
            provincias catholicam fidem invexerunt, aut illam per
            martyrium effuso sanguine collustrarunt.” (Hib. Dom.
            Suppl. p.&nbsp;831.) On the other hand, Janning the
            Bollandist undertakes to prove that St.&nbsp;Rumold was an
            English Saxon. See Janning and J.&nbsp;B. Sellerii Acta
            S.&nbsp;Rumoldi, Antverp,&nbsp;1718; also F.&nbsp;Ward,

              Nero reigned the first five years with so much clemency,
              that once when he was to sign an order for the death of
              a condemned person, he said: “I&nbsp;wish I&nbsp;could
              not write.” But his master Seneca and Burrhus the
              prefect of the prætorium, to whom this his moderation
              was owing, even then discovered in him a bent to
              cruelty, to correct which they strove to give his
              passion another turn. With this view Seneca wrote and
              inscribed to him a treatise On Clemency, which we still
              have. But both Seneca and
              Burrhus connived at an adulterous intrigue in which he
              was engaged in his youth: so very defective was the
              virtue of the best among the heathen philosophers. If
              the tutors imagined that by giving up a part, they might
              save the rest, and by indulging him in the softer
              passions they might check those which seemed more fatal
              to the commonwealth, the event showed how much they were
              deceived by this false human prudence, and how much more
              glorious it would have been to have preferred death to
              the least moral evil, could paganism have produced any
              true martyrs of virtue. The passions are not to be
              stilled by being soothed: whatever is allowed them is
              but an allurement to go farther, and soon makes their
              tyranny uncontrollable. Of this Nero is an instance.
              For, availing himself of this indulgence, he soon gave
              an entire loose to all his desires, especially when he
              began to feel the dangerous pleasure of being master of
              his own person and actions. He plunged himself publicly,
              and without shame or constraint, into the most infamous
              debaucheries, in which such was the perversity of his
              heart, that, as Suetonius tells us, he believed nobody
              to be less voluptuous and abandoned than himself, though
              he said they were more private in their crimes, and
              greater hypocrites: notwithstanding, at that very time,
              Rome abounded with most perfect examples of virtue and
              chastity among the Christians.</p>
            <p>
              There is a degree of folly inseparable from vice. But
              this in Nero seemed by superlative malice to degenerate
              into downright phrenzy. All his projects consisted in
              the extravagances of a madman; and nothing so much
              flattered his pride as to undertake things that seemed
              impossible. He forgot all common rules of decency,
              order, or justice. It was his greatest ambition to sing
              or perform the part of an actor on the stage, to play
              on musical instruments in the theatre, or to drive a
              chariot in the circus. And whoever did not applaud all
              his performances, or had not the complaisance to let him
              carry the prize at every race or public diversion, his
              throat was sure to be cut, or he was reserved for some
              more barbarous death. For cruelty was the vice which
              above all others has rendered his name detestable. At
              the instigation of Poppæa, a most infamous adulteress,
              he caused his mother Agrippina to be slain in the year
              58, and from that time it seemed to be his chief delight
              to glut his savage mind with the slaughter of the
              bravest, the most virtuous, and the most noble persons
              of the universe, especially of those that were nearest
              to him. He put to death his wife Octavia after many
              years ill usage, and he cut off almost all the most
              illustrious heads of the empire.</p></td></tr>

              According to the Registers of Landaff, quoted by Usher,
              St.&nbsp;Oudoceus was son of Budic&nbsp;II. prince of
              Cornwall, in Armorica; and was committed to the care of
              St.&nbsp;Theliau, when he removed to Armorica. But Usher
              is mistaken, as he dates this fact at 596. For we learn
              from St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours that Thierri, son of
              Budic, was made prince of Cornwall in 577, and that his
              father was dead a long time before.</p></td></tr>

              The abbé Ma-Geoghegan, in his history of Ireland,
              published in Paris in 1758, asserts that the Scots were
              originally Scythians, or properly Celto-Scythians, of
              Spanish original. Foreign writers of repute bear witness
              to this extraction: the native historians of Ireland
              have at all times been unanimous in recording it, and
              have adduced testimonies in support of it, which cannot
              be easily overthrown, as some moderns, who made the
              attempt, have experienced. The ancient Fileas of Ireland
              have indeed (like the old poets of all other European
              nations) shrouded real facts in a veil of pompous
              fables. Thus they pretended the leaders of this Spanish
              colony were the descendants of a celebrated Breogan, and
              that a grandson of this Breogan was married to an
              Egyptian heroine named Scota, from whom the Irish took
              the name of Kinea-Scuit or Scots, as they took the
              appellation of Clan-Breogan or Brigantes, from the
              former. But such inventions, acceptable to the credulity
              and flattering to the pride of nations, cannot discredit
              any fact otherwise well attested. The British Brigantes
              were probably descendants of the Irish Brigantes, as the
              Scots of Britain were certainly descendants from those
              of Ireland. Tacitus, in the first age of the Christian
              era, has thought from the difference of complexion and
              frame of body observable among the British tribes of his
              time, that some were of Spanish original; and an earlier
              writer, Seneca, in his satire on the emperor Claudius,
              makes mention of the Scuta-Brigantes, which Scaliger, by
              needless correction, makes Scoto-Brigantes, as the Irish
              wrote Scuit and Scoit indifferently. This testimony of
              Seneca is a proof that the name Scots or Scuits, was
              known to some Roman writers so early as the first
              century; and the Irish appellations of Kinea-Scuit and
              Clan-Breogan plainly point out the proper country of
              those Scuta-Brigantes in the time of the emperor
              Nero.</p>
            <p>
              Mr.&nbsp;Geoghegan looks upon the Irish to be a mother
              tongue; and it may justly be so denominated,
              notwithstanding the adoption of some foreign terms, and
              some variations of construction introduced by time in
              all languages, before they arrive at their classical
              standard. Some writings of the fifth century show that
              this language was at its full perfection before the
              introduction of the gospel by Roman missionaries in the
              fourth and fifth centuries. The notion that this
              language is a dialect of the modern Biscayan is
              undoubtedly groundless. The latter tongue owes its
              original to some nation of those barbarians who settled
              in Guipuscoa and other parts of the Pyrenean regions, on
              the decline of the Roman empire, nor are the few words
              common in the Basque and Irish tongues any proof that
              the one is descended from the other. This observation
              will hold good relatively to the Welsh and Irish
              languages. They differ entirely in syntax, and show that
              the two nations speaking those tongues have different
              Celtic originals.</p>
            <p>
              Bollandus says that St.&nbsp;Patrick taught the first
              alphabet to the Irish: he means the Roman alphabet, and
              should not forget that it was taught very near an age
              before, by earlier missionaries in the parts of Ireland
              which they converted to the faith. In the antecedent
              times the Fileas or ancient Irish writers, inscribed
              their ideas on tablets of wood, by the means of
              seventeen cyphers, of which their ancestors learned the
              use before their arrival in Ireland; nor is this fact
              obscured, but is rather enlightened by a fable of the
              Fileas, setting forth that some of those ancestors were
              instructed in letters by a celebrated Phenius, famous
              for literary knowledge in the East. Through this
              poetical veil we plainly discern the Phenicians, who
              first instructed the Europeans (the Greeks, Lybians,
              Italians, and Spaniards particularly) in the use of
              letters and other arts. Spain, according to Strabo, had
              the use of letters in a very early period; and that a
              colony from that country should import into, and
              cultivate also, those elements of knowledge in Ireland,
              is not improbable: the perfection of the Irish language
              before the introduction of Christianity is an
              incontrovertible proof of the fact.</p>
            <p>
              The Scots are represented as a rude and barbarous people
              in the fourth and fifth ages, even by some eminent
              ecclesiastical writers. But these as well as other
              foreign historians have not, if at all, been resident
              long enough in Ireland to pronounce the natives
              barbarous, if those writers took that epithet in the
              worst sense it can bear. St.&nbsp;Jerom avers that when
              an adolescentulus, he saw a Scot in Gaul feeding upon
              human flesh, but the child, in this case, might impose
              upon the man, or if otherwise, a nation is not to be
              characterised from the barbarity of an individual, or
              even of a single tribe in an extensive country. That
              some barbarous customs prevailed in Ireland during the
              ages mentioned, cannot be denied; and that some prevail
              at this day in most of the modern states of Europe,
              called enlightened, is a matter of fatal experience. In
              the documents still preserved in the native language of
              the ancient Irish, we learn that after the reform made
              of the order of Fileas in the first century, houses and
              ample landed endowments were set apart for those
              philosophers, who, in the midst of the most furious
              civil wars, were by common consent to be left
              undisturbed; that they were to be exempt from every
              employment but that of improving themselves in abstract
              knowledge, and cultivating the principal youths of the
              nation in their several colleges; that in the course of
              their researches they discovered and exposed the corrupt
              doctrines of the Druids; and that an enlightened monarch
              called Cormac O’Quin took the lead among the Fileas in
              the attack upon that order of priests, and declared
              publicly for the unity of the Godhead against
              Polytheism, and for the adoration of one supreme,
              omnipotent, and merciful Creator of heaven and earth.
              The example of that monarch, and the disquisitions of
              the Fileas relating to religion and morality, paved the
              way for the reception of the gospel; and as the
              doctrines of our Saviour made the quickest progress
              among civilized nations, the conversion of Ireland in a
              shorter compass of time than we read of in the
              conversion of any other European country, brings a proof
              that the natives were not the rude barbarians some
              ancient authors have represented them to
              be.</p></td></tr>

            <p>
              St.&nbsp;Germanus, B.&nbsp;C. said to have been
              appointed bishop of the isles by St.&nbsp;Patrick. Under
              his invocation the cathedral of the isle of Man is
              dedicated. St.&nbsp;Macull or Mauchold, in Latin
              Macallius, bishop in the same place from 494 to 518. In
              his honor many churches are dedicated in Scotland, and
              one in the isle of Man. He is honored on the 25th of
              April. St.&nbsp;Brendan, from whom a church in the isle
              of Man is called Kirk-Bradan, was bishop of the isles in
              the ninth century.</p>
            <p>
              N.&nbsp;B. The isle of Man has had its own bishop from
              the time it came into the hands of the English in the
              days of Edward&nbsp;I. of England, and David&nbsp;II. of
              Scotland. It was anciently subject to the bishop of the
              Isles, who always resided at Hy-columbkill till the
              extinction of episcopacy in Scotland, in 1688. The
              bishops both of the isles and of Man took the title of
              Episcopus Sodorensis; which Mr. Keith (p.&nbsp;175)
              derives (not from any towns), but from the Greek word
              Soter or Saviour, because the cathedral of Hy-columbkill
              is dedicated to our Saviour. See Mr.&nbsp;Robert Keith,
              in his new Catalogue of bishops in Scotland, printed at
              Edinburgh, in 4to. An.&nbsp;1755.</p>
            <p>
              Le Neve supposes with Spotiswood that the isle of Man
              had its bishops after Amphibalus, who lived in the
              fourth age, that they were called bishops of Soder from
              a village of that name in the island, and that the title
              was transferred to the island of Hy-columbkill in the
              eighth age, when the two sees were united into one. But
              the succession of bishops in the isle of Man is not
              sufficiently clear.</p>
            <p>
              Matthew Paris says that Wycomb was first bishop of Man,
              in the twelfth age, and that he was consecrated by the
              archbishop of York. See Le Neve. Fasti
              Anglic.</p></td></tr>

              Socrates, in all things he said, used to add this form
              of speech, “By my Dæmon’s leave.” And just upon the
              point of expiring, he ordered a cock to be sacrificed to
              Esculapius (Plato’s Phædo sub finem). And in his trial
              we read one article of his impeachment to have been a
              charge of unnatural lust. Thales, the prince of
              naturalists, being asked by Crœsus what God was, put off
              that prince from time to time, saying, “I&nbsp;will
              consider
              on it.” But the meanest mechanic among the Christians
              can explain himself intelligibly on the Creator of the
              universe. Diogenes could not be contented in his tub
              without gratifying his passions. And when with his dirty
              feet he trod upon Plato’s costly carpets, crying that he
              trampled upon the pride of Plato, he did this, as Plato
              answered him, with greater pride. Pythagoras affected
              tyranny at Thurium, and Zeno at Pyrene. Lycurgus made
              away with himself because he was unable to bear the
              thought of the Lacedæmonians correcting the severity of
              his laws. Anaxagoras had not fidelity enough to restore
              to strangers the goods which they had committed to his
              trust. Aristotle could not sit easy till he proudly made
              his friend Hermias sit below him; and he was as gross a
              flatterer of Alexander for the sake of vanity, as Plato
              was of Dionysius for his belly. From Plato and Socrates
              the stoics derived their proud maxim, “The wise man is
              self-sufficient.” Epictetus himself allows “to be proud
              of the conquest of any vice.” Aristotle (Ethic. ad
              Nicom. l.&nbsp;10, c.&nbsp;7) and Cicero patronize
              revenge. See B. Cumberland of the Laws of Nature,
              c.&nbsp;9, p.&nbsp;346. Abbé Batteux demonstrates the
              impiety and vices of Epicurus mingled with some virtues
              and great moral truths. (La Morale d’Epicure, à Paris,
              1758.) The like blemishes may be found in the doctrine
              and lives of all the other boasted philosophers of
              paganism. See Theodoret. De curandis Græcor.

              King Ina ruled the West-Saxons thirty-seven years with
              great glory, from the abdication of Ceadwalla who died
              at Rome. Ina vanquished the Welsh, several domestic
              rebels, and foreign enemies; made many pious
              foundations, and rebuilt in a sumptuous manner the
              abbey of Glastenbury. Ralph or Ranulph Higden in his
              Polychronicon, and others say this king first
              established the Rome-scot or Peter-pence, which was a
              collection of a penny from every house in his kingdom
              paid yearly to the see of Rome. By considering the
              vanities of the world and moved by the frequent
              exhortations of the queen his wife, he renounced the
              world in 728 in the highest pitch of human felicity, and
              leaving his kingdom to Ethelheard his kinsman, travelled
              to Rome, was there shorn a monk, and grew old in that
              mean habit. His wife accompanied him thither, confirmed
              him in that course, and imitated his example: so that
              living not far from each other in mutual love, and in
              the constant exercises of penance and devotion, they
              departed this life at Rome not without doing divers
              miracles, as William of Malmesbury and
              H.&nbsp;Huntingdon write. In 696 Sebbi, the pious king
              of the East-Saxons, preferred also a private life to a
              crown, took the monastic habit with the blessing of
              bishop Whaldere, successor to St.&nbsp;Erkenwald in the
              see of London, after bestowing a great sum of money in
              charity, and soon after departed this life in the odor
              of sanctity. See Bede b.&nbsp;4,

              From his conversing with St.&nbsp;Basil by an
              interpreter it is clear that St.&nbsp;Ephrem never
              understood the Greek language. The old vicious
              translation of the life of St.&nbsp;Basil, under the
              name of St.&nbsp;Amphilochius, pretends that
              St.&nbsp;Basil obtained for him miraculously the
              knowledge of the Greek tongue, and ordained him priest.
              But this is a double mistake, though the latter was
              admitted by Baillet. Saint Jerom, Palladius, and other
              ancients always style him deacon, never priest. Nor
              does Pseudo Amphilochius say, that St.&nbsp;Basil raised
              St.&nbsp;Ephrem, but only his disciple and companion to
              the priesthood, as the new translation of this piece,
              and an attentive inspection of the original text,
              demonstrate.</p></td></tr>

              John Oosterwican was director to a convent of nuns of
              the same order in Gorcum; he was then very old, and
              often prayed that God would honor him with the crown of
              martyrdom.</p>
            <p>

              Jerom, a native of Werden, in the county of Horn,
              Theodoric of Embden, native of Amorfort, Nicaise
              Johnson, native of Heze, Wilhade, native of Denmark,
              Godfrey of Merveille, Antony of the town of Werden,
              Antony of Hornaire, a village near Gorcum, Francis
              Rodes, native of Brussels. These were priests and
              preachers. The other two were lay-brothers, namely,
              Peter of Asca, a village in Brabant, and Cornelius of
              Dorestate, a village now called Wick, in the territory
              of Utrecht.—The three curates were Leonand Vechel,
              Nicholas Poppel, and Godfrey Dunen. This last was a
              native of Gorcum, who having been rector of the
              university of Paris, where he had studied and taught,
              was some time curate in Holland near the French
              territories, but resigned his curacy and lived at
              Gorcum.</p>
            <p>
              The other martyrs were John Oosterwican mentioned above;
              John, a Dominican of the province of Cologne, curate of
              Hornaire; Adrian Hilvarenbeck, a Norbertin of
              Middleburge, who served a parish at Munster, a village
              near the mouth of the Meuse; James Lacop of the same
              order and monastery, an assistant in a neighboring
              parish to Munster; and Andrew Walter, a secular priest,

              Ceillier and some others think this emperor to have been
              M.&nbsp;Aurelius Antoninus Philosophus, who was a
              persecutor, and reigned with Lucius Verus; the latter
              was absent from Rome in the Parthian war from 162 to
              166; on which account, say these authors, he did not
              appear in this trial. See Tillemont, t.&nbsp;2,
              p.&nbsp;326. But that these martyrs suffered under
              Antoninus Pius, in the thirteenth year of his reign, of
              Christ 150, we are assured by an old inscription in
              several ancient MS. copies of their acts mentioned by
              Ruinart. That this emperor put several Christians to
              death whilst he was governor of Asia before his
              accession to the empire, Tertullian testifies (ad
              Scapul.). And that towards the end of his reign,
              notwithstanding his former mildness towards them, he
              again exercised the sword and torments on them, we have
              an undoubted proof in the genuine epitaph of

              Nisibis was the Assyrian name of this city, which was

              Mygdon, on which it was situated, which gave name to the

              The two elder Assemani place the death of St.&nbsp;James
              in 338, soon after the first siege of Nisibis, of which
              they understand the circumstances which are usually
              ascribed to the second siege; for Theodoret confounds
              them together, as Garnier, (in hunc Theodoreti locum),
              Petau, (in Or. l.&nbsp;Juliani) Henricus Valesius, (in
              Hist. Eccl.). Theodoret, Ammian. Marcell. l.&nbsp;18.
              Pagi, Tillemont, and others observe. Simon Assemani
              confirms this chronology by the express testimony of the
              authors of two Syriac Chronicles, that of Dionysius,
              patriarch of the Jacobits, and that of Edessa. See Simon
              Assemani, Biblio. Orient. t.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;5,
              p.&nbsp;17, and Stephen Evodius Assemani in Op.
              S.&nbsp;Ephrem, t.&nbsp;1. But neither of these
              Chronicles seems of sufficient authority to
              counterbalance the testimony of the Greek historians,
              and the circumstances that persuade us that
              St.&nbsp;James survived the second siege of Nisibis,
              upon which Tillemont, Ceillier, &amp;c., place the death
              of St.&nbsp;James in 350; and Cuper the Bollandist

              These eighteen discourses of St.&nbsp;James are
              mentioned by Gennadius, who gives their titles,
              (t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;901, Op. S.&nbsp;Hier. Veron.
              an.&nbsp;1735,) commended by St.&nbsp;Athanasius (who
              calls them monuments of the simplicity and candor of an
              apostolic mind. Ep. encyclic. ad episcopos Egypti et
              Lybiæ) and by the Armenian writers quoted by Antonelli,
              who demonstrates from the discourses themselves that
              they are a work of the fourth century.</p>
            <p>
              St.&nbsp;James, in the first, On Faith, demonstrates
              this to be the foundation of our spiritual edifice,
              which is raised upon it by hope and love, which render
              the Christian soul the house and temple of God, the
              ornaments of which are all good works, as fasting,
              prayer, chastity, and all the fruits of the Holy Ghost.
              He commends faith from the divine authority of Christ,
              who everywhere requires it, from its indispensable
              necessity, from the heroic virtues which it produces,
              the eminent saints it has formed, and the miracles it
              has wrought. The subject of his second discourse is
              Charity, or the Love of God and our Neighbor, in which
              the whole law of Christ is comprised, and which is the
              most excellent of all virtues, and the perfection of all
              sanctity, admirably taught by Christ both by word and
              example; the end of all his doctrine, mysteries, and
              sufferings being to plant his charity in our hearts. In
              the third discourse he treats on fasting, universal
              temperance, and self-denial, by which we subdue and
              govern our senses and passions, die to ourselves, and
              obtain all blessings of God, and the protection of the
              angels, who are moved to assist and fight for us, as he
              proves from examples and passages of holy writ
              (pp.&nbsp;60, 61,&nbsp;62). In his fourth he speaks on
              Prayer, on which he delivers admirable maxims, teaching
              that its excellence is derived from the purity,
              sanctity, and fervor of the heart, upon which the fire
              descends from heaven, and which glorifies God even by
              its silence. “But none,” says he, “will be cleansed
              unless they have been washed in the laver of baptism,
              and have received the body and blood of Christ. For the
              blood is expiated by this Blood, and the body cleansed
              by this Body. Be assiduous in holy prayer, and in the
              beginning of all prayer place that which our Lord hath
              taught us. When you pray, always remember your friends,
              and me a sinner, &amp;c.”</p>
            <p>
              His fifth discourse, On War, is chiefly an invective
              against pride, in vanquishing which consists our main
              spiritual conflict. The sixth discourse is most
              remarkable. The title is, On Devout Persons, that is,
              Ascetes. The Armenian word <i>Ugdavor</i> signifies one
              who by vow has consecrated himself to God. From this
              discourse it is manifest that some of these Ascetes had
              devoted themselves to God in a state of continency by
              vow, others only by a resolution. The saint most
              pathetically exhorts them to fervor and watchfulness,
              and excellently inculcates the obligation which every
              Christian lies under of becoming a spiritual man formed
              upon the image of Christ, the second Adam, in order to
              rise with him to glory. He inveighs against some Ascetes
              who kept under the same roof a woman Ascete to serve
              them: a practice no less severely condemned by
              St.&nbsp;Gregory Nazianzen (Carm.&nbsp;3, p.&nbsp;56,
              and Or.&nbsp;43, p.&nbsp;701). St.&nbsp;Basil
              (Ep.&nbsp;55, p.&nbsp;149). St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, the
              council of Nice, that of Ancyra, &amp;c. St.&nbsp;James
              was himself an Ascete from his youth, St.&nbsp;Gregory,
              to whom he sends these discourses, was also one, and it
              is clear from many passages in St.&nbsp;Gregory
              Nazianzen, St.&nbsp;Basil, and others, that they were
              very numerous in Cappadocia, Pontus, and Armenia before
              St.&nbsp;Basil founded there the monastic life. See
              Antonelli’s note, ib. p.&nbsp;203. Saint James, in his
              seventh discourse, On Penance, strongly exhorts sinners
              to confess speedily their crimes; to conceal which
              through shame is final impenitence. He adds, the priests
              cannot disclose such a confession (p.&nbsp;237). The
              infidels and several heretics in the first ages of the
              Church denying the general resurrection of bodies,
              St.&nbsp;James proves that mystery in his eighth
              discourse, On the Resurrection of the Dead. His ninth,
              On Humility, is an excellent eulogium of that virtue, by
              which men are made the children of God, and brethren of
              Christ; and it is but justice in man, who is but dust.
              Its fruits are innocence, simplicity, meekness,
              sweetness, charity, patience, prudence, mercy,
              sincerity, compunction, and peace. For he who loves
              humility is always blessed, and enjoys constant peace;
              God, who dwelleth in the meek and humble, abiding in
              him.</p>
            <p>
              The tenth discourse, On Pastors, contains excellent
              advice to a pastor of souls, especially on his
              obligation of watching over and feeding his flock. In
              the eleventh, On Circumcision, and in the twelfth, On
              the Sabbath, he shows against the Jews, that those laws
              no longer oblige, and that the Egyptians learned
              circumcision from the Jews. In the thirteenth, On the
              Choice of Meats, he proves none are unlawful of their
              own nature. In the fourteenth, On the Passover, that the
              Paschal solemnity of Christ’s resurrection has abolished
              that Jewish festival: he adds that the Christian, in
              honor of Christ’s crucifixion, keeps every Friday, and
              also, at Nisibis, the fourteenth day of every month. In
              the fifteenth he proves the Reprobation of the Jews. In
              the sixteenth the Divinity of the Son of God. In the
              seventeenth the Virtue of holy Virginity, which both the
              Ascetes and the clergy professed, and which he defends
              against the Jews only; for he wrote before the heretics
              in the fourth age calumniated the sanctity of that
              state. In the eighteenth he confutes the Jews, who
              pretended that their temple and synagogue would be again
              restored at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>
              The long letter to the priests of Seleucia and Ctesiphon
              against schisms, and dissensions, when Papas, the
              haughty bishop of those cities, had raised there a fatal
              schism, is in some MSS. ascribed to St.&nbsp;James; but
              was certainly a synodal letter sent by a council held on
              that occasion, nine years after the council of Nice: on
              which see the life of St.&nbsp;Miles, and the notes of

              books written by this holy doctor in the Syriac tongue,
              all on pious subjects, or on the Persian persecution.
              They were never translated into Greek.</p>

              Among the heathen emperors of Rome, Titus, the two
              Antonines, and Alexander deserved the best of their
              subjects, and the three last gained a great reputation
              for moral virtue. The Antonines were eminent for their
              learning, and devoted themselves to the Stoic
              philosophy. Arrius Antoninus, who had distinguished
              himself by his moderation and love of justice in several
              magistracies, was adopted by the emperor Adrian in 138,
              and upon his death in the same year ascended the
              imperial throne. He was truly the father of his people
              during a reign of twenty-two years, and died in 161,
              being seventy-seven years old. He obtained the surname
              of Pius, according to some, by his gratitude to Adrian;
              but, according to others, by his clemency and goodness.
              He had often in his mouth the celebrated saying of
              Scipio Africanus, that he would rather save the life of
              one citizen than destroy one thousand enemies. He
              engaged in no wars, except that by his lieutenants he
              restrained the Daci, Alani, and Mauri, and by the
              conduct of Lollius Urbicus quieted the Britons,
              confining the Caledonians to their mountains and forests
              by a new wall. Yet the pagan virtues of this prince were
              mixed with an alloy of superstition, vice, and weakness.
              When the senate refused to enrol Adrian among the gods,
              out of a just detestation of his cruelty and other
              vices, Antoninus, by tears and entreaties, extorted from
              it a decree by which divine honors were granted that
              infamous prince, and he appointed priests and a temple
              for his worship. He likewise caused his wife Faustina to
              be honored after her death as a goddess, and was
              reproached for the most dissolute life of his daughter
              Faustina the younger, whom he gave in marriage to his
              adopted son, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.</p>

              Xiphilin writes that the Christians shared in the
              mildness of his government. Yet though he did not raise
              by fresh edicts any new persecution, it is a notorious
              mistake of Dodwell and some others, who pretend that no
              Christians suffered death for the faith during his
              reign, at least by his order. Tertullian informs us
              (l.&nbsp;ad Scapul. c.&nbsp;4), that Arrius Antoninus,
              when he was only proconsul of Asia, put in execution the
              old unjust rescript of Trajan; and having punished some
              Christians with death, dismissed the rest, crying out to
              them, “O&nbsp;wretches, if you want to die, have you not
              halters and precipices to end your lives by?”
              St.&nbsp;Justin, in his first apology, which he
              addressed to Antoninus Pius, who was then emperor,
              testifies that Christians were tortured with the most
              barbarous cruelty without having been convicted of any
              crime. Also St.&nbsp;Irenæus (l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;3),
              Eusebius (l.&nbsp;4, c.&nbsp;10), and the author of an
              ancient poem which is published among the works of
              Tertullian, are incontestible vouchers that this
              emperor, whom Capitolinus calls a most zealous
              worshipper of the gods, often shed the blood of saints.
              By the acts of St.&nbsp;Felicitas and her sons, it
              appears what artifices the pagan priests made use of to
              stir up the emperors and magistrates against the
              Christians. At length, however, Antoninus Pius, in the
              fifteenth year of his reign, of Christ 152, according to
              Tillemont, wrote to the states of Asia, commanding that
              all persons who should be impeached merely for believing
              in Christ, should be discharged, and their accusers
              punished according to the laws against informers,
              adding, “You do but harden them in their opinion, for
              you cannot oblige them more than by making them die for
              their religion. Thus they triumph over you by choosing
              rather to die than to comply with your will.” See
              Eusebius, l.&nbsp;4, c.&nbsp;26, where he also mentions
              a like former rescript of Adrian to Minutius Fundanus.
              Nevertheless, it is proved by Aringhi (Roma Subterran.
              l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;22), that some were crowned with
              martyrdom in this reign after the aforesaid rescript,
              the pusillanimous prince not having courage always to
              protect these innocent subjects from the fury of the
              populace or the malice of some governors.</p></td></tr>

              Though Pliny and Procopius pretend that the Vandals were
              of the same extraction with the Goths, the contrary is
              demonstrated by the learned F.&nbsp;Daniel Farlati
              (Illyrici Sacri, t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;1308, Venetiis
              1753), and by Jos. Assemani (in Calend. de Orig. Slavor.
              par.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;5, t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;297). And
              their language, manners, and religion, were entirely
              different. The same arguments show that they differed
              also from the Slavi, Huns, and original Winidi or
              Venedi, this last being a Sarmatian, and the two others
              Scythian nations. The Vandals are placed by Jornandes
              and Dio (l.&nbsp;55) on the German coast of the Baltic
              sea, in the present Prussia and Pomerania; they thence
              extended themselves to the sources of the Elbe, in the
              mountains of Silesia. They were afterward removed near
              the Danube, in the neighborhood of the Marcomanni, in
              the reigns of Antoninus, Aurelian, and Probus. In the
              fifth century they made an excursion into Gaul; and
              being there repulsed, crossed the Pyrenæan mountains
              with the Alani, who were the original Massagetæ from
              mount Caucasus, and beyond the Tanais, as Ammianus
              Marcellinus testifies. About the year 400, in the reign
              of Honorius, the Alani settled themselves in Lusitania,
              and the Vandals under king Gunderic, in Gallicia (which
              then comprised both the present Gallicia and Old
              Castile), and in Bætica, which from them was called
              Vandalitia, and corruptly Andalusia. (See St.&nbsp;
              Isidore and Idatius, in their chronicles, Salvian,
              l.&nbsp;7, p.&nbsp;137, St.&nbsp;August. ep.&nbsp;3, ad
              Victor.) The Vandals were baptized in the Catholic faith
              about the time when they crossed the Rhine; but were
              afterward drawn into Arianism, probably by some alliance
              with the Arian Goths, and out of hatred to the Romans.
              Idatius says, that common fame attributed the Arian
              perversion of the Vandals to king Genseric, who
              succeeded his brother Gunderic in 428, and was a man
              experienced in all the arts of policy and war. Count
              Boniface, lieutenant of Africa, seeing his life
              threatened by Aëtius (who, with the title of Magister
              Militiæ, governed the empire for the empress Placidia,
              regent for her son Valentinian), invited the Vandals out
              of Spain to his assistance. Genseric, with a powerful
              army, passed the strait which divides Africa from Spain,
              in May, 429, and though Boniface was then returned to
              his duty, the barbarian everywhere defeated the Romans,
              besieged Hippo during fourteen months; and though he was
              obliged by a famine to retire, he returned soon after
              and took that strong fortress. The emperor Valentinian,
              in 435, by treaty yielded up to him all his conquests in
              Africa. Genseric soon broke the truce, and in 439 took
              Carthage, and drove the Romans out of all Africa. In
              455, being invited by the Empress Eudoxia to revenge the
              murder of Valentinian on Maximus, he plundered Rome
              during fifteen days. Though that city had been ravaged
              by Alaric the Goth in 400, whilst Honorius was emperor,
              the Vandal found and carried off an immense booty; and
              among other things, the gold and brass with which the
              capitol was inlaid, and the vessels of the Jewish temple
              at Jerusalem, which Titus had brought to Rome. These
              Justinian, when he had recovered Africa, caused to be
              brought to Constantinople, whence he caused them to be
              removed and placed in certain churches at Jerusalem, as
              Procopius relates. Rome was again twice plundered by
              Totila, in 546 and 549. The Vandals, by their
              transmigrations into Spain and Africa, soon after ceased
              to be a nation in Germany, as Jornandes and Procopius
              testify. Euricus, king of the Visigoths, in Languedoc,
              in 468, invading Spain, conquered most of the
              territories which the Romans still possessed there, and
              all the provinces which the Vandals had seized. So that
              by the extinction of the empire of the Vandals in Africa
              under Justinian, the name of that potent and furious
              nation was lost: though Frederic, the first king of
              Prussia, in 1701, was for some time very desirous rather
              to take the title of king of the Vandals. The cavalry of
              the ancient Vandals fought chiefly with the sword and
              lance, and were unpractised in the distant combat. Their
              bowmen were undisciplined, and fought on foot like the
              Gothic. See Procopius.</p></td></tr>

              written with spirit and correctness, in a plain
              affecting style, intermixed with an entertaining
              poignancy of satire, and edifying heroic sentiments and
              examples of piety. The author is honored in the Roman
              Martyrology among the holy confessors on the 23d of

              uncertain. He flourished in the middle of the fifth
              century. His history of the Vandalic persecution has run
              through several editions: that of Beatus Rhenanus at

              The Roman provinces, in Africa, soon after sunk again
              into barbarism and infidelity, being overrun in 668 by
              the Saracens from Arabia and Syria, who in 669 took also
              Syracusa, and established a kingdom in Sicily and part
              of Italy. They planted themselves in Spain in 707.
              Muhavia, a general of the Sultan Omar, having routed
              Hormisdas Jesdegird, king of Persia, in 632, translated
              that monarchy from the line of Artaxerxes to the
              Saracens. This Omar conquered Egypt in 635. He was
              second caliph after Mahomet, and successor of Abubeker;
              and from his time the caliphs of Bagdat or Babylon were
              masters of Syria, Persia, and Egypt, till the two latter
              revolted; but notwithstanding various revolutions, all
              those countries still retain the Mahometan superstition.
              The Mahometans in Egypt shook off the yoke of the
              caliphs of Bagdat, and set up their own caliphs at Cairo
              in 870, to whom the Moors in Africa adhered till the
              Turks became masters of Egypt.</p></td></tr>

              The exact number of years that some of the popes sat
              before Victor in the year 200, cannot be determined with
              any degree of certainty, partly on account of faults of
              copies and the disagreement of later pontificals. (See
              Pagi, the Bollandists, Tillemont, Orsi, Berti, &amp;c.)
              St.&nbsp;Peter sat twenty-five years; St.&nbsp;Linus
              seems to have held the see about eleven years,
              St.&nbsp;Cletus twelve years, St.&nbsp;Clement about
              eleven years, and St.&nbsp;Anacletus nine, dying about
              the year 109. The tradition and registers of the Roman
              church show Anacletus and Cletus to have been two
              distinct popes, as is manifest from the Liberian
              Calendar and several very ancient lists of the first
              popes quoted by Schelstrate (Diss.&nbsp;2, Ant. Eccl.
              c.&nbsp;2.) and the Bollandists (ad 26&nbsp;Apr.) from
              the old poem among the works of Tertullian, written
              about the time that he lived; from the very ancient
              Antiphonaries of the Vatican church, published by
              cardinal Joseph Thomasius, and the old Martyrology which
              bore the name of St.&nbsp;Jerom, and was printed at
              Lucca by the care of Francis-Maria-Florentinius, a
              gentleman of that city; which original authorities were
              followed by Ado, Usuard, &amp;c. The pontificals call

              B.&nbsp;Giles was a native of Assisio, and became the
              third companion of St.&nbsp;Francis in 1209. He attended
              him in the Marche of Ancona, and made a pilgrimage to
              Jerusalem, whither he was sent by St.&nbsp;Francis to
              preach to the Saracens; but upon their threats of
              raising a persecution he was sent back to Italy by the
              Christians of that country. He afterward lived some time
              at Rome, some time at Reati, and some time at Fabriano;
              but the chief part of the remainder of his life he spent
              at Perugia, where he died in the night between the 22d
              and the 23d of April, in the year 1272, not in 1262, as
              Papebroke proves against the erroneous computation of
              certain authors. (p.&nbsp;220, t.&nbsp;3, Apr.) Wading
              and others relate many revelations, prophecies, and
              miracles of this eminent servant of God; his tomb has
              been had in public veneration at Perugia from the time
              of his death, and he was for some time solemnly honored
              as a saint in the church of his order in that city, as
              Papebroke shows; who regrets that this devotion has been
              for some time much abated, probably because not judged
              sufficiently authorized by the holy see. The public
              veneration at his tomb and the adjoining altar
              continues, and the mass is sung, on account of his
              ancient festival, with great solemnity, but of
              St.&nbsp;George, without any solemn commemoration of
              this servant of God. Nevertheless, from proofs of former
              solemn veneration, Papebroke honors him with the title
              of Blessed.</p>
            <p>
              None among the first disciples of St.&nbsp;Francis seems
              to have been more perfectly replenished with his spirit
              of perfect charity, humility, meekness, and simplicity,
              as appears from the golden maxims and lessons of piety
              which he gave to others. Of these Papebroke has given us
              a large and excellent collection from manuscripts: some
              of which were before printed by Wading and others.
              A&nbsp;few will suffice to show us his
              spirit.</p>

              B.&nbsp;Giles always lived by the labor of his hands.
              When the cardinal bishop of Tusculum desired him always
              to receive his bread as a poor man an alms, from his
              table, B.&nbsp;Giles excused himself, using the words of
              the psalmist: <i>Blessed art thou, and it shall be well
              with thee, because thou shalt eat by the labor of thy
              hands.</i> Ps.&nbsp;cxxvii. “So brother Francis taught
              his brethren to be faithful and diligent in laboring,
              and to take for their wages not money, but necessary
              subsistence.” (Papebroke, p.&nbsp;224.) If any one
              discoursed with him on the glory of God, the sweetness
              of his love, or Paradise, he would be ravished in
              spirit, and remain so great part of the day unmoved.
              Shepherds and children who had learned this from others,
              sometimes for diversion or out of curiosity, cried out
              after him, Paradise, Paradise; upon hearing which, he
              through joy fell into an ecstasy. His religious brethren
              in conversing with him took care never to name the word
              Paradise or Heaven for fear of losing his company by his
              being ravished out of himself. (ib., p.&nbsp;226, and
              Wading.)</p>
            <p>
              An extraordinary spiritual joy and cheerfulness appeared
              always painted on his countenance; and if any one spoke
              to him of God, he answered in great interior jubilation
              of soul. Once returning to his brethren out of close
              retirement, he praised God with wonderful joy and
              fervor, and sung,—“Neither tongue can utter, nor words
              express, nor mortal hearts conceive how great the good
              is which God hath prepared for those who desire to love
              him.”</p>
            <p>
              Pope Gregory&nbsp;IX., who kept his court at Perugia
              from 1234 to autumn in 1236, sent one day for the holy
              man, who, in answer to his holiness’s first question
              about his state of life, said,—“I&nbsp;cheerfully take
              upon me the yoke of the commandments of the Lord.” The
              pope replied,—“Your answer is just; but your yoke is
              sweet and your burthen light.” At these words
              B.&nbsp;Giles withdrew a little from him, and, being
              ravished in spirit, remained speechless and without
              motion till very late in the night, to the great
              astonishment of his holiness, who spoke of it to his
              cardinals and others with great surprise.</p>
            <p>
              This pope on a certain occasion pressed the holy man to
              say something to him on his own duty; Giles after having
              long endeavored to excuse himself said, “You have two
              eyes, both a right and a left one, always open; with the
              right eye you must contemplate the things which are
              above you; and with the left eye you must administer and
              dispense things which are below.”</p>
            <p>
              On humility, the following maxims are recorded among his
              sayings: “No man can attain to the knowledge of God but
              by humility. The way to mount high is to descend; for
              all dangers and all great falls which ever happened in
              the world, were caused by pride, as is evident in the
              angel in heaven, in Adam in Paradise, in the Pharisee
              mentioned in the gospel; and all spiritual advantages
              arose from humility, as we see in the Blessed Virgin,
              the good thief, &amp;c. Would to God some great weight
              laid upon us obliged us always to hold down our heads.”
              When a certain brother asked him; “How can we fly this
              cursed pride?” he answered; “If we consider the benefits
              of God, we must humble ourselves, and bow down our
              heads. And if we consider our sins, we must likewise
              humble ourselves, and bow down our heads. Wo to him who
              seeks honor from his own confusion and sin. The degrees
              of humility in a man are, that he know that whatever is
              of his own growth is opposite to his good. A&nbsp;branch
              of this humility is, that he give to others what is
              theirs, and never appropriate to himself what belongs to
              another; that is, that he ascribe to God all his good
              and all advantages which he enjoys; and acknowledge that
              all his evil is of his own growth. Blessed is he who
              accounts himself as mean and base before men as he is
              before God. Blessed is he who walks faithfully in
              obedience to another. He who desires to enjoy inward
              peace, must look upon every man as his superior, and as
              better and greater before God. Blessed is he who knows
              how to keep and conceal the favors of God. Humility
              knows not how to speak, and patience dares not speak,
              for fear of losing the crown of suffering by complaints,
              in a firm conviction that a person is always treated
              above his deserts. Humility dispels all evil, is an
              enemy to all sin, and makes a man nothing in his own
              eyes. By humility a man finds grace before God, and
              peace with men. God bestows the treasures of his grace
              on the humble, not on the proud. A&nbsp;man ought always
              to fear from pride, lest it cast him down headlong.
              Always fear and watch over yourself. A&nbsp;man who
              deserves death, and who is in prison, how comes it that
              he does not always tremble? A&nbsp;man is of himself
              poverty and indigence; rich only by the divine gifts;
              these then he must love, and despise himself. What is
              greater than for a man to be sensible what he owes to
              God, and to cover himself with confusion, self-reproach,
              and self-reprehension for his own evils? I&nbsp;wish we
              could have studied this lesson from the beginning of the
              world to the end. How much do we stand indebted to him
              who desires to deliver us from all evil, and to confer
              upon us all good.” Against vain-glory he used to
              say;—“If a person was sunk in extreme poverty, covered
              all over with wounds, half-clad in tattered rags, and
              without shoes; and men should come to him, and saluting
              him with honor say: ‘All admire you, my lord; you are
              wonderfully rich, handsome, and beautiful; and your
              clothes are splendid and handsome;’ must not he have
              lost his senses, who should be pleased with such a
              compliment, or think himself such, knowing that he is
              the very reverse?”</p>
            <p>
              The servant of God was remarkable for his meekness and
              charity, and he used to say, “We can appropriate to
              ourselves our neighbor’s good, and make it also our own;
              for the more a person rejoices at his neighbor’s good,
              the more does he share in it. If therefore you desire to
              share in the advantages of all others, rejoice more for
              them all; and grieve for every one’s misfortunes. This
              is the path of salvation, to rejoice in every advantage
              and to grieve for every misfortune of your neighbor; to
              see and acknowledge your evils and miseries, and to
              believe only good of others; to honor others, and
              despise yourself. We pray, fast, and labor; yet lose all
              this if we do not bear injuries with charity and
              patience. If we take so much pains to attain to virtue,
              why do not we learn to do what is so easy? you must bear
              the burdens of all, because you have no just reason of
              complaint against any one, seeing you deserve to be
              chastised and treated ill by all creatures. You desire
              to escape reproaches and condemnation in the next world,
              yet would be honored in this. You refuse to labor or
              bear anything here, yet desire to enjoy rest hereafter.
              Strive more earnestly to vanquish your passions, and
              bear tribulations and humiliations. It is necessary to
              overcome yourself, whatever you do. It avails your soul
              little to draw others to God unless you die to
              yourself.”</p>
            <p>
              On prayer, which this servant of God made his constant
              occupation and delight, he used to say,—“Prayer is the
              beginning and the consummation of all good. Every sinner
              must pray that God may make him know his miseries and
              sins, and the divine benefits. He who knows not how to
              pray, knows not God. All who are to be saved, if they
              have attained the use of reason, must set themselves to
              pray. Though a woman were ever so bashful and simple, if
              she saw her only son taken from her by the king’s orders
              for some crime, she would tear her breasts, and implore
              his mercy. Her love and her son’s extreme danger and
              miseries would make her never want words to entreat
              him.”</p>
            <p>
              The fruits and graces of perfect prayer he summed up as
              follows: 1.&nbsp;“By it a man is enlightened in his
              understanding. 2.&nbsp;He is strengthened in faith and
              in the love of all good. 3.&nbsp;He learns to know and
              feel his own miseries. 4.&nbsp;He is penetrated with
              holy fear, is humble and contemptible in his own eyes.
              5.&nbsp;His heart is pierced with compunction.
              6.&nbsp;Sweet tears flow in abundance. 7.&nbsp;His heart
              is cleansed. 8.&nbsp;His conscience purged. 9.&nbsp;He
              learns obedience. 10.&nbsp;Attains to the perfect spirit
              of that virtue. 11.&nbsp;To spiritual science.
              12.&nbsp;To spiritual understanding. 13.&nbsp;Invincible
              fortitude. 14.&nbsp;Patience. 15.&nbsp;Spiritual wisdom.
              16.&nbsp;The knowledge of God, who manifests himself to
              those who adore him in spirit and truth. Hence love is
              kindled in the soul, she runs in the odor of his sweet
              perfumes, is drowned in the torrent of his sweetness,
              enjoys perfect interior peace, and is brought to
              immortal glory.”</p></td></tr>

              Gerson calls St.&nbsp;Bonaventure both a cherub and a
              seraph, because his writings both enlighten and inflame.
              His order makes his doctrine the standard of their
              schools, according to a decree of pope Pius&nbsp;V. To
              the works of St.&nbsp;Bonaventure these divines add the
              double comments of Scotius on Aristotle and the Master
              of the Sentences.</p>
            <p>
              Peter Lombard, a native of Novara in Lombardy, was
              recommended by St.&nbsp;Bernard (ep.&nbsp;366) to
              Gilduin, first abbot of the regular canons of
              St.&nbsp;Victor’s at Paris, performed there his studies,
              professed that order, and was one of those who, by an
              order of abbot Suger, king Louis&nbsp;VII. and pope
              Eugenius&nbsp;III. in 1147, were sent from
              St.&nbsp;Victor’s to St.&nbsp;Genevieve’s in place of
              the secular canons. Eudes or Odo, one of this number,
              was chosen first regular abbot of St.&nbsp;Genevieve’s,
              on whose eminent virtues see the pious F.&nbsp;Gourdan,
              in his MS. history of the eminent men of
              St.&nbsp;Victor’s, in 7&nbsp;vols. folio, t.&nbsp;2,
              p.&nbsp;281. Peter Lombard taught theology at
              St.&nbsp;Genevieve’s, till in 1159 he was made bishop of
              Paris. Gourdan, ib. t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;79 and&nbsp;80.
              He died, bishop of that city, in 1164. He compiled a
              body of divinity, collected from the writings of the
              fathers, into four books, called Of the Sentences, from
              which he was surnamed The Master of the Sentences. This
              work he is said by some to have copied chiefly from the
              writings of Blandinus his master, and others. (See James
              Thomasius De Plagio literario, from sect.&nbsp;493
              to&nbsp;502.) Though it be not exempt from inaccuracies,
              the method appeared so well adapted to the purposes of
              the schoolmen that they followed the same and for their
              lectures gave comments on these four books of the
              Sentences. Among these, St.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas stands
              foremost. The divines of the Franciscan Order take for
              their guides St.&nbsp;Bonaventure and John Duns Scotus.
              This latter was born in Northumberland, and entered
              young into the Order of St.&nbsp;Francis at Newcastle.
              He performed his studies, and afterward taught divinity
              at Oxford, where he wrote his Commentaries on the Master
              of the Sentences, which were thence called his Oxonian
              Commentaries. He was called to Paris about the year
              1304, and in 1307 was appointed by his Order, Regent of
              their theological schools in that University, where he
              published his Reportata in Sententias, called his Paris
              Commentaries, which are called by Dr. Cave a rough or
              unfinished abstract of his Oxford Commentaries. For the
              subtilty and quickness of his understanding, and his
              penetrating genius, he was regarded as a prodigy. Being
              sent by his Order to Cologne in 1308, he was received by
              the whole city in procession, but died on the 8th of
              November the same year, of an apoplexy, being
              forty-three, or as others say, only thirty-four years
              old. The fable of his being buried alive is clearly
              confuted by Luke Wading, the learned Irish Franciscan,
              who published his work, with notes, in twelve tomes,
              printed at Lyons in 1636. Natalis Alexander, a most
              impartial inquirer into this dispute, and others, have
              also demonstrated that story to have been a most
              groundless fiction. Wading, Colgan, &amp;c., say that
              Duns Scotus was an Irishman, and born at Down in Ulster.
              John Major, Dempster, and Trithemius say he was a
              Scotchman, born at Duns, eight miles from England. But
              Leland, Wharton, Cave, and Tanner, prove that he was an
              Englishman and a native of Dunstone, by contraction
              Duns, a village in Northumberland, in the parish of
              Emildun, then belonging to Merton-hall in Oxford, of
              which hall he was afterward a member. This is attested
              in the end of several manuscript copies of his Comments
              on the Sentences, written soon after the time when he
              lived, and still shown at Oxford in the colleges of
              Baliol and Merton. That he was a Scotchman or an
              Irishman, no author seems to have asserted before the
              sixteenth century, as Mr.&nbsp;Wharton observes. (See
              Cave, t.&nbsp;2, Append. p.&nbsp;4. Wood, Athen. Oxon.

              works.)</p>
            <p>
              William Ockham, a native of Surrey, also a Grey Friar, a
              scholar of Duns Scotus at Paris, disagreeing from his
              master in opinions, raised hot disputes in the schools,
              and became the head or leader of the Nominals, a sect
              among the schoolmen who in philosophy explain things
              chiefly by the properties of terms; and maintain that
              words, not things, are the object of dialectic, in
              opposition to the others called Realists. Ockham was
              provincial of his Order in England in 1322, and
              according to Wood (Hist. et Ant. l.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;87)
              wrote a book On the Poverty of Christ, and other
              treatises against Pope John&nbsp;XXII., by whom he was
              excommunicated. He became a warm abettor of the schism
              of Louis of Bavaria, and his antipope, Peter Corbarius,
              and died at Munich in 1347. He is said also to have
              favored the heresy of the Fratricelli, introduced by
              certain Grey Friars in the marquisate of Ancona, who
              made all perfection to consist in a seeming poverty,
              rebelled against the Church, and railed at the pope and
              the other pastors. Flying into Germany, they were
              favored by Louis of Bavaria, and in return supported his
              schism. They at length rejected the sacraments as
              useless. Akin to these were the Beguards and Beguines,
              an heretical sect formed by several poor laymen and
              women, who, some by an ill-governed devotion and a love
              of a lazy life, others out of a spirit of libertinism,
              would needs imitate the poverty of the Friars
              Mendicants, without being tied to obedience, or living
              under superiors. They at length fell into many
              extravagant errors, and became a society of various
              notions and opinions, which had nothing common but the
              hatred they bore to the pope and other prelates, and the
              affectation of a voluntary poverty, under which they
              covered an infinite number of disorders and crimes. Such
              are the baneful fruits of self-conceit.</p></td></tr>

              This observation of St.&nbsp;Camillus has been since
              confirmed by many instances of persons who were found to
              have been buried alive, or to have recovered long after
              they had appeared to have been dead. Accounts of several
              such examples are found in many modern medical and
              philosophical memoirs of literature which have appeared
              during this century, especially in France and Germany;
              and experience evinces the case to have been frequent.
              Boerhaave (Not. in Instit. Medic.) and some other men
              whose names stand among the foremost in the list of
              philosophers, have demonstrated by many undoubted
              examples, that where the person is not dead, an entire
              cessation of breathing and of the circulation of the
              blood may happen for some time, by a total obstruction
              in the organical movements of the springs and fluids of
              the whole body, which obstruction may sometimes be
              afterwards removed, and the vital functions restored.
              Whence the soul is not to be presumed to leave the body
              in the act of dying, but at the moment in which some
              organ or part of the body <i>absolutely</i> essential to
              life is <i>irreparably</i> decayed or destroyed. Nor can
              any certain mark be given that a person is dead till
              some evident symptom of putrefaction commenced appears
              sensible.</p>
            <p>
              Duran and some other eminent surgeons in France, in
              memorials addressed, some to the French king, others to
              the public, complain that two customs call for redress,
              first, that of burying multitudes in the churches, by
              which experience shows that the air is often extremely
              infected; the second is that of which we speak. To
              prevent the danger of this latter, these authors insist
              that no corpse should be allowed to be buried, or its
              face close covered, before some certain proof of
              putrefaction, for which they assign as usually one of
              the first marks, if the lower jaw being stirred does not
              restore itself, the spring of the muscles being lost by
              putrefaction. See Doctor Bruhier, Mémoire présenté au
              Roi, sur la Nécessité d’un Règlement Général au Sujet
              des Enterments et Embaumements, in 1745; also

              The Romans usually kept the bodies of the dead eight
              days, and practised a ceremony of often calling upon
              them by their names, of which certain traces remain in
              many places from the old ceremonial for the burial of
              kings and princes. Servabantur cadavera octo diebus, et
              calida abluebantur, et post ultimam conclamationem
              abluebantur. Servius in Virgilii Æneidon, l.&nbsp;8,
              ver.&nbsp;2,&nbsp;8. The corpse was washed whilst warm,
              and again after the last call addressed to the deceased
              person, which was the close of the ceremony before the
              corpse was burnt or interred; and to be deprived of it
              was esteemed a great misfortune. Corpora nondum
              conclamata jacent, Lucan. l.&nbsp;2, ver.&nbsp;22. Jam

              The empire of the West, which had been extinguished in
              Augustulus, was restored in the year 800, in the person
              of Charlemagne, king of France, who extended his
              conquests into part of Spain, almost all Italy, all
              Flanders and Germany, and part of Hungary. The imperial
              crown continued some time in the different branches of
              his family, sometimes in France, sometimes in Germany,
              and sometimes in both united under the same monarch.
              Louis&nbsp;IV. the eighth hereditary emperor of the
              Franks, was a weak prince, and died in the twentieth
              year of his age, in 912, without leaving any issue.
              These emperors, in imitation of the Lombards, had
              created several petty sovereigns in their states, who
              grew very powerful. These princes declared that by the
              death of Louis&nbsp;IV. the imperial dignity was
              devolved on the Germanic people; and excluding Charles
              the Simple, king of France, the next heir in blood of
              the Carlovingian race, elected Conrad&nbsp;I. duke of
              Franconi: and after him Henry&nbsp;I. surnamed the
              Fowler, duke of Saxony, who was succeeded by three
              Othos of the same family of Saxony. After
              St.&nbsp;Henry&nbsp;II. several emperors (the following
              Henries, and two Frederics in particular) were of the
              Franconian family. Rodolph&nbsp;I. of the house of
              Austria was chosen in 1273. There have been four dukes
              of Bavaria emperors, five of the house of Luxemburg,
              three of the old Bohemian royal house, &amp;c. But in
              1438, Albert&nbsp;II. duke of Austria and marquis of
              Moravia, was raised to that supreme dignity, which from
              that time has remained chiefly in that family. The
              ancient ducal house of Saxony was descended from
              Wittekind the Great, the last elected king of the
              Saxons, who afterwards sustained a long obstinate war
              against Pepin and Charlemagne, submitted to the latter,
              and being baptized by St.&nbsp;Lullus in 785, was
              created by Charlemagne, first duke of Saxony.
              St.&nbsp;Henry&nbsp;II. was the fifth Emperor of the
              Saxon race, descended from Wittekind the
              Great.</p></td></tr>

              On the authenticity of this diploma of Henry&nbsp;II.
              and also of those of Pepin, Charlemagne, and
              Otho&nbsp;I. see the Dissertation of the Abbé Cenni,
              entitled, Esame de Diploma d’Ottone è S.&nbsp;Arrigo,
              printed at Rome in 1754.</p>
            <p>
              That the see of Rome was possessed of great riches, even
              during the rage of the first persecutions, is clear from
              the acts of universal charity performed by the popes,
              mentioned by St.&nbsp;Dionysius of Corinth, and after
              the persecutions by St.&nbsp;Basil and St.&nbsp;John
              Climacus. From the reign of Constantine the Great, many
              large possessions were bestowed on the popes for the
              service of the Church. Conni (Esame di Diploma di
              Ludovico Pio) shows in detail from St.&nbsp;Gregory the
              Great’s epistles, that the Roman see, in his time,
              enjoyed very large estates, with a very ample civil
              jurisdiction, and a power of punishing delinquents in
              them by deputy judges, in Sicily, Calabria, Apulia,
              Campania, Ravenna, Sabina, Dalmatia, Illyricum,
              Sardinia, Corsica, Liguria, the Alpes Cottiæ, and a
              small estate in Gaul. Some of these estates comprised
              several bishoprics, as appears from St.&nbsp;Gregory,
              l.&nbsp;7, ep.&nbsp;39, Indict.&nbsp;ii.</p>
            <p>
              The Alpes Cottiæ that belonged to the popes included
              Genoa and the sea-coast from that town to the Alps, the
              boundaries of Gaul, as Thomassin (l.&nbsp;1, de Discipl.
              Eccl. c.&nbsp;27, n.&nbsp;17.) takes notice, and as
              Baronius (ad an.&nbsp;712, p.&nbsp;9.) proves from the
              testimony of Oldradus, bishop of Milan. And Paul the
              deacon writes, that the Lombards seized the Alpes
              Cottiæ, which were the estates of the Roman see.
              “Patrimonium Alpium Cottiarum quæ quondam ad jus
              pertinuerant apostolicæ sedis, sed a Longobardis multo
              tempore fuerant ablatæ.” (Paul. Diac. l.&nbsp;6,
              c.&nbsp;43.) Father Cajetan, in his Isagoge ad Historiam
              Siculam, points out at length the different estates
              which the Roman see formerly possessed in Sicily. The
              popes were charged with a great share of the care of the
              city and civil government of Rome. St.&nbsp;Gregory the
              Great mentions that it was part of their duty to provide
              that the city was supplied with corn, (l.&nbsp;5,
              ep.&nbsp;40, alias l.&nbsp;4, ep.&nbsp;31, ad Maurit.)
              and that he was obliged to watch against the stratagems
              of the enemies, and the treachery of the Roman generals
              and governors. (l.&nbsp;5, ep.&nbsp;42, alias l.&nbsp;4,
              ep.&nbsp;35.) And he appointed Constantius a tribune to
              be governor of Naples. (l.&nbsp;2, ep.&nbsp;11, alias
              ep.&nbsp;7.) Anastasius the Librarian testifies that the
              popes Sisinnius and Gregory&nbsp;II. both repaired the
              walls of Rome and put the city in a posture of
              defence.</p>
            <p>
              From these and other facts Thomassin observes that the
              popes had then the chief administration of the city of
              Rome and of the exarchate, made treaties of peace,
              averted wars, defended and recovered cities, and
              repulsed the enemies. (Thomass. da Benefic.&nbsp;3,
              part. l.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;29, n.&nbsp;6.) When the
              Lombards ravaged and conquered the country, the emperors
              continued to oppress the people with exorbitant taxes,
              yet being busy at home against the Saracens, refused to
              protect the Romans against the barbarians. Whereupon the
              people of Italy, in the time of Gregory&nbsp;II. in 715,
              chose themselves in many places leaders and princes,
              though that pope exhorted them every where to remain in
              their obedience and fidelity to the empire, as
              Anastasius the Librarian assures us: “Ne desisterent ab
              amore et fide Romani imperii admonebat.”</p>
            <p>
              Leo the Isaurian, and his son Constantine Copronymus
              persecuted the Catholics; yet Zachary and
              Stephen&nbsp;II. paid them all due obedience and respect
              in matters relating to the civil government. Leo
              threatened to destroy the holy images and profane the
              relics of the apostles at Rome. At which news the people
              of Rome were not to be restrained, but having before
              received with honor the images of that emperor,
              according to custom, they, in a fit of sudden fury,
              pulled them down. Pope Stephen&nbsp;II. exhorted the
              emperor to forbear such sacrileges and persecutions, and
              at the same time gave him to understand the danger of
              exasperating the populace, though he did what in him lay
              to prevent by entreaties both the profanations
              threatened by the emperor, and also the revolt of the
              people: “Tunc projecta laureata tua conculcarunt—Aisque:
              Romam mittam, et imaginem S.&nbsp;Petri confringam.—Quòd
              si quospiam miseris, protestamur, tibi, innocentes sumus
              a sanguine quem fusuri sunt.” On the sacrileges and
              cruelties exercised by the Iconoclasts in the East, see
              the Bollandists, August&nbsp;ix. To prevent the like at
              Rome, some of the Greek historians say that pope
              Gregory&nbsp;II. withdrew himself and all Italy from the
              obedience of the emperor. But Theophanes and the other
              Greeks were in this particular certainly mistaken, as
              Thomassin takes notice. And Natalis Alexander says:
              (Diss.&nbsp;1, sæc.&nbsp;8.) “This most learned pope was
              not ignorant of the tradition of the fathers from which
              he never deviated. For the fathers always taught that
              subjects are bound to obey their princes, though
              infidels or heretics, in those things which belong to
              the rights of the commonwealth.”</p>
            <p>
              The case was, that when the emperors refused to protect
              Italy from the barbarians, the popes in the name of the
              people, who looked upon them as their fathers and
              guardians, and as the head of the commonwealth, sought
              protection from the French, as Thomassin observes
              (p.&nbsp;3, de Benef. l.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;29.) The
              continuator of Fredegarius seems to say, that
              Gregory&nbsp;III. and the Roman people created Charles
              Martel Patrician of Rome, by which title was meant the
              protection of the Church and poor, as De Marca (De
              Concordiâ, l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;11, n.&nbsp;6.) and Pagi
              explain it from Paul the deacon. At last pope
              Stephen&nbsp;II. going into France to invite Pepin into
              Italy, conferred on him the title of Patrician, but had
              not recourse to this expedient till the Eastern empire
              had absolutely abandoned Italy to the swords of the
              Lombards. Pope Zachary made a peace with Luitprand, king
              of the Lombards, and afterward a truce with king Rachis
              for twenty years. But that prince putting on the
              Benedictin habit, his brother and successor Astulphus
              broke the treaty. Stephen&nbsp;II. who succeeded Zachary
              in 752, sent great presents to Astulphus, begging he
              would give peace to the exarchate; but could not be
              heard, as Anastasius testifies. Whereupon Stephen went
              to Paris, and implored the protection of king Pepin, who
              sent ambassadors into Lombardy, requiring that Astulphus
              would restore what he had taken from the church of Rome,
              and repair the damages he had done the Romans. Astulphus
              refusing to comply with these conditions, Pepin led an
              army into Italy, defeated the Lombards, and besieged,
              and took Astulphus in Pavia; but generously restored him
              his kingdom on condition he should live in amity with
              the pope. But immediately after Pepin’s departure he
              perfidiously took up arms, and in revenge put every
              thing to fire and sword in the territories of Rome. This
              obliged Pepin to return into Italy, and Astulphus was
              again beaten and made prisoner in Pavia. Pepin once more
              restored him his kingdom, but threatened him with death
              if he ever again took up arms against the pope; and he
              took from him the exarchate of Ravenna, of which the
              Lombard had made himself master, and he gave it to the
              holy see in 755, as Eginhard relates: “Redditam sibi
              Ravennam et Pentapolim, et omnem exarchatum ad Ravennam
              pertinentem, ad S.&nbsp;Petrum tradidit.” Eginhard, ib.
              Thomassin observes very justly that Pepin could not give
              away dominions which belonged to the emperors of
              Constantinople; but that they had lost all right to them
              after they had suffered them to be conquered by the
              Lombards, without sending succors during so many years
              to defend and protect them. These countries therefore
              either by the right of conquest in a just war belonged
              to Pepin and Charlemagne, who bestowed them on the
              popes; or the people became free, and being abandoned to
              barbarians had a right to form themselves into a new
              government. See Thomassin (p.&nbsp;3, de Beneficiis,
              l.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;29, n.&nbsp;9).</p>
            <p>
              It is a principle laid down by Puffendorf, Grotius,
              Fontanini, and others, demonstrated by the unanimous
              consent of all ancients and moderns, and founded upon
              the law of nations, that he who conquers a country in a
              just war, nowise untaken for the former possessors, nor
              in alliance with them, is not bound to restore to them
              what they would not or could not protect and defend:
              “Illud extra controversiam est, si jus gentium
              respiciamus, quæ hostibus per nos erepta sunt, ea non
              posse vindicari ab his qui ante hostes nostros ea
              possederant et amiserant.” (Grotius, l.&nbsp;3, de Jure
              belli et pacis, c.&nbsp;6,&nbsp;38.) The Greeks had by
              their sloth lost the exarchate of Ravenna. If Pepin had
              conquered the Goths in Italy, or the Vandals in Africa
              before Justinian had recovered those dominions, who will
              pretend that he would have been obliged to restore them
              to the emperors? Or, if the Britons had repulsed the
              Saxons after the Romans had abandoned them to their
              fury, might they not have declared themselves a free
              people? Or, had not the popes and the Roman people a
              right, when the Greeks refused them protection, to seek
              it from others? They had long in vain demanded it of the
              emperors of Constantinople, before they had recourse to
              the French. Thus Anastasius testifies that pope
              Stephen&nbsp;II. had often in vain implored the succors
              of Leo against Astulphus. “Ut juxta quod ei sæpius
              scripserat, cum exercitu ad tuendas has Italiæ partes
              modis omnibus adveniret.” The same Anastasius relates,
              that when the ambassadors of the Greek emperor demanded
              of Pepin the restitution of the countries he had
              conquered from the Lombards, that prince answered, that
              as he had exposed himself to the dangers of war merely
              for the protection of St.&nbsp;Peter’s see, not in favor
              of any other person, he never would suffer the apostolic
              Church to be deprived of what he had bestowed on it.
              Pepin gave to the holy see the city of Rome and its
              Campagna; also the exarchate of Ravenna and Pentapolis,
              comprising Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia, Ancona,
              Gubbio, &amp;c. He retained the office of protector and
              defender of the Roman church under the title of
              Patrician. When Desiderius, king of the Lombards, again
              ravaged the lands of the church of Rome, Charlemagne
              marched into Italy, defeated his forces, and after a
              long siege took Pavia, and extinguished the kingdom of
              the Lombards in 773, on which occasion he caused himself
              to be crowned king of Italy, with an iron crown, such as
              the Goths and Lombards in that country had used, perhaps
              as an emblem of strength. Charlemagne confirmed to pope
              Adrian&nbsp;I. at Rome, the donation of his father
              Pepin. The emperor Charles the Bald and others ratified
              and extended the same. Charlemagne having been crowned
              emperor of the West at Rome, by pope Leo&nbsp;III. in
              800, Irene, who was then empress of Constantinople,
              acknowledged him Augustus in 802; as did her successor
              the emperor Nicephorus&nbsp;III. The Greeks at the same
              time ratified the partition made of the Italian
              dominions. This point of history has been so much
              misrepresented by some moderns, that this note seemed
              necessary in order to set it in a true light. See

              In the partition of the empire between Charlemagne and
              Irene, empress of Constantinople, Apulia and Calabria
              were assigned to the Eastern empire, and the rest of
              Naples to Charlemagne and his successors. Long before
              this, in the unhappy reign of the Monothelite emperor
              Constans, about the year 660, the Saracens began to
              infest Sicily, and soon after became masters of that
              island, and also of Calabria and some other parts of
              Italy. Otho&nbsp;I. surnamed the Great, drove them out
              of&nbsp;Italy, and laid claim to Calabria and Apulia by
              right of conquest. The Greeks soon after yielded up
              their pretensions to those provinces by the marriage of
              Otho&nbsp;II. to Theophania, daughter of Romanus,
              emperor of the East, who brought him Apulia and Calabria
              for her dowry. Yet the treacherous Greeks joined the
              Saracens in those provinces, and again expelled the
              Germans. But in 1008, Tancred, a noble Norman, lord of
              Hauteville, with his twelve sons, and a gallant army of
              adventurers, went from Normandy into Apulia, and had
              great success against the Saracens and their
              confederates the Greeks. From this time the Normans
              became dukes of Calabria, and counts and dukes of
              Apulia. Robert Guiscard, the most valiant Norman duke of
              Apulia, augmented his power by the conquest of Sicily,
              Naples, and all the lands which lie between that city
              and Latium or the territory of Rome. In 1130, Roger the
              Norman was saluted by the pope, king of both
              Sicilies.</p></td></tr>

              Our saint’s colleague St.&nbsp;Wiro (in Irish Bearaidhe)
              is honored on the 8th of May. By the Four Masters he is
              styled abbot of Dublin; but with the Irish annalists,
              bishop and abbot are generally synonymous terms. He died
              in 650. See Ware.</p>
            <p>
              St.&nbsp;Plechelm’s other fellow-missionary,
              St.&nbsp;Otger, is honored on the 10th of September; he
              is always styled deacon, by which it appears that he was
              never promoted to the priesthood. From his name and
              other circumstances it is thought he was an
              English-Saxon, though from the North, probably the
              southern parts of Scotland anciently subject to the
              kings of the Northumbers. Being desirous to accompany
              SS.&nbsp;Wiro and Plechelm to Rome, and in their
              apostolic missions into Germany, when Pepin gave the
              Mount of St.&nbsp;Peter or of St.&nbsp;Odilia to
              St.&nbsp;Wiro, the three saints settled there together
              and ended their days in that monastery. Whether
              St.&nbsp;Otger outlived St.&nbsp;Plechelm is uncertain.
              All three were buried in the monastery of Berg, or of
              Mount St.&nbsp;Peter or St.&nbsp;Odilia; and their
              bodies remained there till, in 858, that monastery was
              given by king Lothaire to Hunger, bishop of Utrecht,
              when the greatest part of these relics was translated to
              Utrecht. Part still remained in the church of Berg, till
              with the chapter of canons it was removed to Ruremund.
              These relics were hid some time in the civil wars for
              fear of the Calvinists, but discovered in 1594, and
              placed again above the high altar. The portion at
              Utrecht was also hid for a time for fear of the Normans;
              but found and exposed to public veneration again by
              bishop Baldric. See the life of Saint Otger, with notes

              That prelate had been educated at Cæsarea, where he
              studied with St.&nbsp;Pamphilus the martyr, whose name
              he afterward added to his own. He suffered imprisonment
              with him for the faith about the year 309, but recovered
              his liberty without undergoing any severer trial, and
              was chosen archbishop of Cæsarea in 314. When Arius, in
              320, retired from Alexandria into Palestine, having been
              deposed from the priesthood by St.&nbsp;Alexander the
              year before, Eusebius of Cæsarea and some other bishops
              were imposed upon by him, and received him favorably.
              Hereupon Arius wrote to Eusebius of Nicomedia, whom he
              calls brother to the other Eusebius of Cæsarea. Eusebius
              of Nicomedia was at that time of an advanced age, and
              had great interest with Constantine, who after the
              defeat of Licinius kept his court some time at Nicomedia
              as other emperors had done before him since Dioclesian
              had begun to reside in the East. This prelate was crafty
              and ambitious; his removal, procured by his intrigues,
              from his first see of Berytus to Nicomedia seems to have
              given occasion to the canon of the Nicene council, by
              which such translations were forbidden. Notwithstanding
              which, in defiance of so sacred a law, he afterwards
              procured himself to be again translated to the see of
              Constantinople, in 338, in the beginning of the reign of
              Constantius. The Council of Sardica, in 347, confirmed
              the above-mentioned Nicene canon under pain of the
              parties being deprived even of lay communion at their
              death; but this arch-heretic died in 342. He openly
              defended not only the person, but also the errors of
              Arius; subscribed the definitions of the Nicene council
              for fear of banishment: but three months after, being
              the author of new tumults, he was banished by
              Constantine, and after three years recalled, upon giving
              a confession of faith in which he declared himself
              penitent, and professed that he adhered to the Nicene
              faith, as Theodoret relates. By this act of
              dissimulation he imposed upon the emperor, but he
              continued by every base art to support his heresy, and
              endeavored to subvert the truth. Eusebius of Cæsarea
              held that see from 314 till his death in 339. He was
              always closely linked with the ringleaders of the
              heresy. Nevertheless, the learned Henry Valois, in his
              Prolegomena to his translation of this author’s
              Ecclesiastical History, pretends to excuse him from its
              errors, though he often boggled at the word
              Consubstantial. He certainly was so far imposed upon by
              Arius, as to believe that heretic admitted the eternity
              of the Divine Word; and in his writings many passages
              occur which prove the divinity, and, as to the sense,
              the consubstantiality of the Son, whatever difficulties
              he formed as to the word. On which account Ceillier and
              many others affect to speak favorably, or at least
              tenderly of Eusebius in this respect, and are willing to
              believe that he did not at least constantly adhere to
              that capital error. Yet it appears very difficult
              entirely to clear him from it, though he may seem to
              have attempted to steer a course between the tradition
              of the Church and the novelties of his friends. See
              Baronius ad an. 380, Witasse Nat. Alexander, and the
              late Treatise in folio, against the Arian heresy,
              complied by a Maurist Benedictin monk. Photius, in a
              certain work given us by Montfaucon (in Bibl. Coisliana,
              p.&nbsp;358), roundly charges Eusebius with Arianism and
              Origenism.</p>
            <p>
              Eusebius, whose conduct was so unconstant and equivocal,
              shines to most advantage in his works, especially those
              which he composed in defence of Christianity before the
              Arian contest arose. The first of these is his book
              against Hierocles, who, under Dioclesian, was a
              prosecuting judge at Nicomedia, and afterward rewarded
              for his cruelty against the Christians with the
              government of Egypt. In a book he wrote he made
              Apollonius Tyanæus superior to Christ. But Eusebius
              demonstrates the history of this magician, written by
              Philostratus, when he taught rhetoric at Rome, one
              hundred years after the death of that magician, to be
              false and contradictory in most of its points, doubtful
              in others, and trifling in all. About the time he was
              made bishop he conceived a design of two works, which
              showed as much the greatness of his genius, as the
              execution did the extent of his knowledge. The first of
              these he called The Preparation, the other The
              Demonstration of the Gospel. In the first he, with great
              erudition, confutes idolatry, in fifteen books, showing
              that the Greeks borrowed the sciences and many of their
              gods from the Egyptians, whose true history agrees with
              that of Moses; but the fictions of their theology are
              monstrous, impious, and condemned by their own learned
              men; that their oracles, which were only a chain of
              impostures and frauds, or the responses of devils, never
              attained to any infallible knowledge of contingencies,
              and were silenced by a power which they acknowledged
              superior. He also shows the Unity of God, and the truth
              of his revealed religion as ancient as the world. In his
              Demonstration of the Gospel, in ten books, he shows that
              the Jewish law in every point clearly points out Christ
              and the gospel. These books of Evangelical Preparation
              and Demonstration furnish more proofs, testimonies and
              arguments for the truth of the Christian religion than
              any other work of the ancients on that subject.</p>
            <p>
              Eusebius’s two books against Marcellus of Ancyra, and
              three On Ecclesiastical Theology, are a confutation of
              Sabellianism. His topography or alphabetical explication
              of the places mentioned in the Old Testament, is most
              exact and useful. It was translated into Latin, and
              augmented by St.&nbsp;Jerom. Eusebius’s useful comments
              on the Psalms were published by Montfaucon (Collect.
              Nova Script. Græc. Paris, 1706). His fourteen
              Discourses, or Opuscula, published by F.&nbsp;Sirmond
              (Op. Sirmond, t.&nbsp;1), are esteemed genuine, though
              not mentioned by the ancients. His discourse on the
              Dedication of the Church at Tyre, rebuilt after the
              persecution in 315, contains a curious description of
              that ceremony and of the structure. By his letter to his
              Church of Cæsarea, after the conclusion of the council
              of Nice, he recommended to his flock the definitions and
              creed of that assembly. His panegyric of Constantine was
              delivered at Constantinople in presence of that prince,
              who then celebrated the thirtieth year of his reign by
              public games. The praises are chiefly drawn from the
              destruction of idolatry; but study reigns in this
              composition more than nature, and renders the discourse
              tedious, though the author took some pains to polish the
              style. His four books of the life of Constantine were
              written in 338, the year after that emperor’s death. The
              style is diffusive, and the more disagreeable by being
              more labored. Phocius reproaches the author for
              dissembling or suppressing the chief circumstances
              relating to Arius, and his condemnation in the council
              of Nice.</p>
            <p>
              The Chronicle of Eusebius was a work of immense labor,
              in two parts; the first, called his Chronology,
              contained the distinct successions of the kings and
              rulers of the principal nations from the beginning of
              the world; the second part, called the Chronicle or the
              Rule of Times, may be called the table of the first, and
              unites all the particular chronologies of different
              nations in one. The second part was translated into
              Latin, and augmented by St.&nbsp;Jerom. The first part
              was lost when Joseph Scaliger gathered the scattered
              fragments from George Syncellus, Cedrenus, and the
              Alexandrian chronicle; but Scaliger ought to have
              pointed out his sources; and has inserted many things
              which certainly belong not to Eusebius.</p>
            <p>
              Our author’s name has been rendered most famous by his
              ten books of Church History, which he brings down to the
              defeat of Licinius, in 323, when he first wrote it,
              though he revised it again in 326. He collected the Acts
              of the martyrs of Palestine, an abstract of which he
              added to the eighth book of his History. Rufinus
              elegantly translated this work into Latin, reduced to
              nine books, to which he added two others, wherein he
              brings down his history to the death of Theodosius.
              Eusebius copied very much Julius Africanus in his
              chronicle; and in his History, St.&nbsp;Hegesippos (who
              had compiled a History from Christ to 170) and others.
              This invaluable work is not exempt from some mistakes
              and capital omissions; nor was the author much
              acquainted with the affairs of the Western Church. See
              Ceillier, t.&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;258, &amp;c.
              Christophorson, bishop of Chichester, elegantly
              translated this History into Latin, but changed the
              manner of dividing the chapters. The translation of the
              learned Henry Valesius is most accurate. Eusebius was
              one of the most learned prelates of antiquity, and a man
              of universal reading; but he did not much study to
              polish his discourses, which is the common fault of
              those that make learning and knowledge their chief
              business.</p></td></tr>

              St.&nbsp;Jerom (ep.&nbsp;126, p.&nbsp;38) calls
              St.&nbsp;Eustathius a loud sounding trumpet, and says he
              was the first who employed his pen against the Arians.
              The same father admires the extent of his knowledge,
              saying that it was consummate both in sacred and profane
              learning (ep.&nbsp;84, p.&nbsp;327). His just praises
              are set forth by St.&nbsp;Chrysostom in an entire
              panegyric; and Sozomen assures us (l.&nbsp;1, c.&nbsp;2)
              that he was universally admired both for the sanctity of
              his life, and the eloquence of his discourses. The
              elegant works which he composed against the Arians were
              famous in the fifth century, but have not reached us.
              But we have still his Treatise on the Pythonissa or
              Witch of Endor, published by Leo Allatius, with a
              curious Dissertation, and reprinted in the eighth tome
              of the Critici Sacri. In it the author undertakes to
              prove against Origen that this witch neither did nor
              could call up the soul of Samuel, but only a spectre or
              devil representing Samuel, in order to deceive Saul. He
              clearly teaches that before the coming of Christ the
              souls of the just rested in Abraham’s bosom; and that
              none could enter heaven before Christ had opened it; but
              that Christians enjoy an advantage above the patriarchs
              and prophets, in being united with Christ immediately
              after their death if they have lived well. This treatise
              is well written, and justifies the commendations which
              the ancients give to this great prelate and eloquent
              orator. Sozomen justly calls his writings admirable, as
              well for the purity of his style as for the sublimity of
              thought, the beauty of the expression, or the curious
              choice of the matter. Nothing more enhances his virtue,
              than the invincible constancy and patience with which he
              suffered the most reproachful accusation with which his
              enemies charged him, and the unjust deposition and
              banishment which were inflicted on him.</p></td></tr>

              Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus is commonly known
              by the last name. His father was a centurion in the
              proconsular troops of Africa, and he was born at
              Carthage about the year 160. He confesses that before
              his conversion to the Christian faith he, in his merry
              fits, pointed his keenest satire against it (Apol.,
              c.&nbsp;18), had been an adulterer (De Resur.
              c.&nbsp;59), had taken a cruel pleasure in the bloody
              entertainments of the amphitheatre (De Spectac.
              c.&nbsp;19), attained to a distinguishing eminency in
              vice (De Pœnit. c.&nbsp;4), “Ego præstantiam in delictis
              meam agnosco,” and was an accomplished sinner in all
              respects, (ib. c.&nbsp;12. “Peccator omnium notarum cum
              sim,”) yet having his head marvellously well turned for
              science, he applied himself from his cradle to the study
              of every branch of good literature, poetry, philosophy,
              geometry, physic, and oratory; he dived into the
              principles of each sect, and both into the fabulous and
              into the real or historical part of mythology. His
              comprehensive genius led him through the whole circle of
              profane sciences; above the rest, as Eusebius tells us,
              he was profoundly versed in the Roman laws. He had a
              surprising vivacity and keenness of wit, and an uncommon
              stock of natural fire which rendered him exceeding hot
              and impatient, as himself complains (l.&nbsp;de Patient.
              in init.) His other passions he restrained after his
              conversion to Christianity; but this vehemence of temper
              he seems never to have sufficiently checked. The motives
              which engaged him to embrace the gospel seem those upon
              which he most triumphantly insists in his works; as the
              antiquity of the Mosaic writings, the mighty works and
              wisdom of the divine lawgiver, the continued chain of
              prophecy and wonders conducting the attentive inquirer
              to Christ, the evidence of the miracles of Christ and
              his apostles, the excellency of the law of the gospel,
              and its amazing influence upon the lives of men; the
              power which every Christian then exercised over evil
              spirits, and the testimony of the very devils themselves
              whom the infidels worshipped for gods, and who turned
              preachers of Christ, howling, and confessing themselves
              devils in the presence of their own votaries, (Apol.
              c.&nbsp;19, 20,&nbsp;23, &amp;c.&nbsp;&amp;c.) also the
              constancy and patience of the martyrs (l.&nbsp;ad
              Scapul. c. ult.)&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
              Being by his lively and comprehensive genius excellently
              formed for controversy, he immediately set himself to
              write in defence of religion, which was then attacked by
              the Heathens and Jews on one side, and on the other
              corrupted by heretics. He successfully employed his pen
              against all these enemies to truth, and first against
              the Pagans. The persecution which began to rage gave
              occasion to his Apologetic, which is not only his
              masterpiece, but indisputably one of the best among all
              the works of Christian antiquity. This piece was not
              addressed to the Roman senate, as Baronius and several
              others thought, but to the proconsul and other
              magistrates of Africa, and perhaps to all the governors
              of provinces and magistrates of the empire, among whom
              he might also comprise the Roman senators; for the title
              of Presidents only, agreed to these provincial
              governors, and he names the proconsuls; (ch.&nbsp;45)
              speaks of Rome as at a distance: (c.&nbsp;9, 21, 24,
              35,&nbsp;45) says they practised at home (at Carthage),
              the bloody religious rites of the Scythians; (c.&nbsp;9)
              and by those words, “in ipso fere vertice civitatis
              præsidentes,” he seems to mean the <i>Byrsa</i> of
              Carthage; certainly not Rome, which he always calls
              <i>Urbs</i>, not <i>civitas</i>.</p>
            <p>
              In the first part of this work he clears Christians from
              the calumnies of incest and murder thrown upon them, and
              demonstrates the injustice of punishing them merely for
              a name, and exposes the absurdity of Trajan’s order
              commanding them to be punished if impeached, yet not to
              be sought after. He mentions that Tiberius, and after
              his miraculous victory, Marcus Aurelius, were favorable
              to the Christian religion. He then proceeds to confute
              idolatry; asks, if Bacchus was made a god for planting
              vines, why did not Lucullus attain to the same honor,
              because he first brought cherry-trees from Pontus to
              Rome? Why Aristides the Just, Socrates, Crœsus,
              Demosthenes, and so many others who had been most
              eminent, were not admitted to share divine honors with
              Jupiter, Venus, &amp;c.? He explains the chief articles
              of our faith, and speaking of the origin and false
              worship of the demons he inserts the most daring
              challenge, which Saint Cyprian (ep. ad Demetrianum),
              Lactantius (De Just. l.&nbsp;5, c.&nbsp;21) and other
              primitive fathers repeat with the same assurance,—“Let a
              demoniac be brought into court,” says Tertullian, “and
              the evil spirit that possesses him be commanded by any
              Christian to declare what he is, he shall confess
              himself as truly to be a devil as he did falsely before
              declare himself a god. In like manner let them bring any
              of those who are thought to be inspired by some god, as
              Æsculapius, &amp;c. If all these do not declare
              themselves in court to be devils, not daring to lie to a
              Christian, do you instantly put that rash Christian to
              death.”</p>
            <p>
              The apologist mentions the submission of Christians to
              the emperors, their love of their enemies, and their
              mutual charity, horror of all vice, and constancy in
              suffering death and all manner of torments for the sake
              of virtue. The heathens called them in derision
              Sarmentitians and Semaxians, because they were fastened
              to trunks of trees, and stuck about with faggots to be
              set on fire. But Tertullian answers them: “Thus dressed
              about with fire, we are in our most illustrious apparel.
              These are our triumphal robes embroidered with
              palm-branches in token of victory (such the Roman
              generals wore in their solemn triumphs), and mounted
              upon the pile we look upon ourselves as in our triumphal
              chariot. Who ever looked well into our religion but he
              came over to it? and who ever came over to it but was
              ready to suffer for it? We thank you for condemning us,
              because there is such a blessed discord between the
              divine and human judgment, that when you condemn us upon
              earth, God absolveth us in heaven.”</p>
            <p>
              Tertullian wrote about the same time his two books
              Against the Gentiles, in the first confuting their
              slanders, in the second attacking their false gods. An
              accidental disputation of a Christian with a Jewish
              proselyte engaged him to show the triumph of the faith
              over that obstinate race, who seemed deaf to all
              arguments. His book Against the Jews is just, solid, and
              well supported, a model of theological controversy,
              which wants but a little clearness of diction to be a
              very finished piece. Hermogenes, a Stoic philosopher,
              and a Christian, broached a new heresy in Africa,
              teaching matter to be eternal. Tertullian shows it to
              have been created by God with the world, and unravels
              the sophistry of that heresiarch in its book Against
              Hermogenes. That Against the Valentinians is rather a
              satire and raillery, than a serious confutation of the
              extravagant sentiments of those heretics. His excellent
              book Of Prescription against Heretics was certainly
              written before his fall; for in it he lays great stress
              on his communion with all the apostolic churches,
              especially that of Rome, and confutes by general
              principles all heresies that can arise.</p>
            <p>
              His design in this little treatise is to show, that the
              appeal to scripture is very unjust in heretics, who have
              no claim or title to the scriptures. These were
              carefully committed in trust by the apostles to their
              successors, and he proves, that to whom the scriptures
              were intrusted, to them also was committed the
              interpretation of scripture. He promises that heresies
              are the very pest and destruction of faith, but no just
              cause of scandal or wonder, any more than fevers which
              consume the human body; for they were predicted by
              Christ, and the necessary consequence of criminal
              passions. He says, as if it had been to anticipate or
              remove the offence which he afterward gave by his fall:
              “What if a bishop, a deacon, a widow, a virgin, a
              teacher, or even a martyr, shall fall from the faith;—Do
              we judge of the faith by the persons or of persons by
              their faith? No man is wise who holds not the faith.”
              (c.&nbsp;3.) He says: “We have no need of a nice inquiry
              after we have found Christ, or of any curious search
              after we have learned the gospel. If we believe we
              desire nothing further than to be believers.”
              (c.&nbsp;7.) He adds, some heretics inculcate as a good
              reason for eternal scruple and searching, that it is
              written: <i>Seek and ye shall find</i>. But he takes
              notice those words only belonged to those Jews who had
              not yet found Christ, and cannot mean, that we must for
              ever seek on. But if we are to seek, it must not be from
              heretics who are estranged from the truth, who have no
              power to instruct, no inclination but to destroy, and
              whose very light is darkness. Christ laid down a rule of
              faith, about which there can be no cavils, no disputes
              but what are raised by heretics; and an obstinate
              opposition to this rule is what constitutes a
              heretic.</p>
            <p>
              He inveighs against too curious searches in faith, as
              the source of heresies. Then coming close to the point,
              he will not have heretics admitted to dispute about the
              scriptures, to which they have no claim; and in such a
              scriptural disputation, the victory is precarious and
              very liable to uncertainty. All then is to be resolved
              into what the apostles have taught; which apostolical
              tradition is the demonstration of the truth, and the
              confutation of all error and heretical innovation. Our
              perfect agreement, and general consent and harmony with
              the apostolic churches which live in the unity of the
              same faith, is the most convincing proof of the truth,
              against which no just objection can possibly be formed.
              (c.&nbsp;21,&nbsp;22.) He urges that Marcion, Apelles,
              Valentinus, and Hermogenes were of too modern a date,
              and proved by their separation and pretended claim of
              what was ancient, that the Church was before them; they
              ought therefore to say, that Christ came down again from
              heaven and taught again upon earth, before they can
              commence apostles. “But,” says he, “if any of these
              heretics have the confidence to put in their claim to
              apostolic antiquity, let them show us the original of
              their churches, the order and succession of their
              bishops, so as to ascend up to an apostle,” &amp;c. He
              is for having the heretics prove their mission by
              miracles, like the apostles. (c.&nbsp;35.) He writes:
              “To these men the Church might thus fitly address
              herself: Who are ye? When, and from whence came ye? What
              do ye in my pastures, who are none of mine? By what
              authority do you, Marcion, break in upon my enclosures?
              Whence, O&nbsp;Apelles, is your power to remove my
              land-marks? This field is mine of right, why then do you
              at your pleasure sow and feed therein? It is my
              possession; I&nbsp;held it in times past; I&nbsp;first
              had it in my hands; my title to it is firm and
              indisputable, and derived from those persons whose it
              was, and to whom it properly belonged; I&nbsp;am the
              heir of the apostles; as they provided in their
              testament, as they committed and delivered to my trust,
              as they charged and ordered me, so I&nbsp;hold.”
              (c.&nbsp;37.) He takes notice that in the Pagan
              superstitions the devil had imitated many ceremonies
              both of the Jewish and Christian religion; and that
              heretics in like manner were bad copies of the true
              Church. (c.&nbsp;40.) He appeals to the manners and
              conversation of the heretics which are vain, earthly,
              without weight, without discipline, in every respect
              suitable to the faith they profess.
              (c.&nbsp;41,&nbsp;43.) “I&nbsp;am very much mistaken,”
              says he, “if they are governed by any rules, even of
              their own making, since every one models and adopts the
              doctrine he has received according to his fancy, as the
              first founder framed them to his, and to serve his own
              turn. The progress of every heresy was formed upon the
              footsteps of its first introducers; and the same liberty
              that was assumed by Valentinus and Marcion, was
              generally made use of by their followers. If you search
              into all sorts of heresies, you will find that they
              differ in many things from the first authors of their
              own sect. They have few of them in any Church; but
              without mother, without see, without the faith, they
              wander up and down like exiled men, entirely devoid of
              house and home.” (c.&nbsp;42.)</p>
            <p>
              Among his other works, the most useful is the book On
              Penance, the best polished of all his writings; in the
              first part, he treats of repentance at baptism; in the
              second, on that for sins committed after baptism. He
              teaches here that the Church hath power to remit even
              fornication, which he denied when a Montanist. He
              insists much on the laborious exercises of this penance
              after baptism.</p>
            <p>
              A&nbsp;book On Prayer, explaining in the first part the
              Lord’s Prayer; in the second, several ceremonies often
              used at prayer. An exhortation to Patience, in which the
              motives are displayed with great eloquence. An
              exhortation to Martyrdom, than which nothing can be more
              pathetic.</p>
            <p>
              He wrote a book On Baptism, proving in the first part,
              its obligation and necessity; in the second, treating on
              several points of discipline relating to that
              sacrament.</p>
            <p>
              As to his other works, in his first book to his Wife,
              written probably before he was priest (see Ceillier,
              p.&nbsp;375, and&nbsp;391), he exhorts her not to marry
              again, if she should survive him; and mentions several
              in the Church living in perpetual continency. In the
              second, he allows second marriages lawful, but if the
              woman be determined to engage a second time in the
              married state, insists that it is unlawful to marry an
              infidel. He alleges the impossibility of rising to
              prayer at night, giving suitable alms, visiting the
              martyrs, &amp;c. with a pagan husband: “Can you conceal
              yourself from him,” says he, “when you make the sign of
              the cross upon your bed or your body?—Will he not know
              what you receive in secret, before you take any food?”
              that is, the eucharist, (l.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;5.) He
              concludes with an amiable description of a Christian
              holy marriage: “The Church,” saith he, “approves the
              contract, the oblation ratifies it, the blessing is the
              seal of it, and the angels carry it to the heavenly
              Father who confirms it. Two bear together the same yoke,
              and are but one flesh, and one mind: they pray together,
              fast together, mutually exhort each other, go together
              to the church, and to the table of the Lord. They
              conceal nothing from each other, visit the sick, collect
              alms without restraint, assist at the offices of the
              Church without interruption, sing psalms and hymns
              together, and encourage each other to praise God.”</p>
            <p>
              In his treatise On the Shows, he represents them as
              occasions of idolatry, impurity, vanity, and other
              vices, and mentions a woman who, going to the theatre,
              returned back possessed with a devil: when the exorcist
              reproached the evil spirit for daring to attack one of
              the faithful, it boldly answered: “I&nbsp;found her in
              my own house.” In his book On Idolatry, he determines
              many cases of conscience, relating to idolatry, as that
              it is not lawful to make idols, &amp;c., but he says, a
              Christian servant may attend his master to a temple: any
              friend may assist at an idolater’s marriage, &amp;c. In
              two books On the Ornaments or Dress of Women, he
              zealously recommends modesty in attire, and condemns
              their use of paint. In that On veiling Virgins, he
              undertakes to prove that young women ought to cover
              their faces at church, contrary to the custom of his
              country, where only married women were veiled. In that
              On the Testimony of the Soul, he proves that there is
              only one God from the natural testimony of every one’s
              soul. In his Scorpiace, written against the poison of
              the Scorpions, that is, Gnostics, especially a branch of
              those heretics named Cainites, he proves the necessity
              of martyrdom, which they denied. In his Exhortation to
              Chastity, he dissuades a certain widow from a second
              marriage, which he allows to be lawful, though hardly
              so; and the harshness of his expressions show that he
              then leaned toward Montanism.</p>
            <p>
              Tertullian was a priest, and continued in the Church
              till the middle of his life, that is, to forty or
              upwards, when he miserably fell. Montanus, an eunuch in
              Phrygia, set up for a prophet, and was wonderfully
              agitated by an evil spirit, and pretended to raptures in
              which he lost his senses, and spoke incoherently, not
              like St.&nbsp;Quadratus and other true prophets. He was
              joined by Prisca, or Priscilla, and Maximilla, two women
              of quality, and rich, but of most debauched lives. These
              had the like pretended raptures, and many were deceived
              by them. Montanus, about the year 171, pretended that he
              had received the Holy Ghost to complete the law of the
              gospel, and was called by his followers the Paraclete.
              Affecting a severity of doctrine, to which his manners
              did not correspond, he condemned second marriages, and
              flight in persecution, and ordered extraordinary fasts.
              The Montanists said that, beside the fast of Lent
              observed by the Catholics, there were other fasts
              imposed by the Divine Spirit. They kept three Lents in
              the year, each of two weeks, and upon dry meats, as
              necessary injunctions of the Spirit by the new
              revelations made to Montanus, which they preferred to
              the writings of the apostles; and they said these laws
              were to be observed for ever. (See Tert. de Jejun.
              c.&nbsp;15, also St.&nbsp;Jerom, ep.&nbsp;54, ad
              Marcellam, et in Aggæ, c.&nbsp;1), which is the reason
              why the Montanists, even in the time of Sozomen, kept
              their Antepaschal fast confined to two weeks, which the
              Catholics at that time certainly observed of forty days.
              For, as bishop Hooper (of Lent, p.&nbsp;65), remarks,
              those great fasters would hardly have been left behind,
              had they not been restrained by the pretended
              institution of the Spirit, to which they punctually
              kept; and this circumstance rendered these facts
              superstitious. Pepuzium, a town in Phrygia, was the
              metropolis of these heretics, who called it Jerusalem.
              The bishops of Asia having examined their prophecies
              and errors, condemned them. It is said, that Montanus
              and Maximilla going mad, hanged themselves. See
              Eusebius.</p>
            <p>
              Tertullian’s harsh, severe disposition fell in with this
              rigidness. His vehement temper was for no medium in any
              thing; and failing first by pride, he resented some
              affronts which he imagined he had received from the
              clergy of Rome, as Saint Jerom testifies; and in this
              passion deserted the Church, forgetting the maxims by
              which he had confuted all heresies. Solomon’s fall did
              not prejudice his former inspired writings. Nor does the
              misfortune of Tertullian destroy at least the justness
              of the reasoning in what he had written in defence of
              the truth, any more than if a man lost his senses, this
              unlucky accident could annul what he had formerly done
              for the advancement of learning.</p>
            <p>
              Tertullian is the most ancient of all ecclesiastical
              writers among the Latins. St.&nbsp;Vincent of Lerins,
              who is far from shading the blemishes of this great man,
              says, “He was among the Latins what Origen was among the
              Greeks—that is, the first man of his age. Every word
              seems a sentence, and almost every sentence a new
              victory. Yet with all these advantages, he did not
              continue in the ancient and universal faith. His error,
              as the blessed confessor Hilary observes, has taken away
              that authority from his writings which they would have
              otherwise deserved.” St.&nbsp;Jerom in his book against
              Helvidius, when his authority was objected, coolly
              answered, “That he is not of the Church,” “Ecclesiæ
              hominem non esse.” Yet he sometimes speaks
              advantageously of his learning. Lactantius calls his
              style uncouth, rugged, and dark, but admires his depth
              of sense; and he who breaks the shell will not repent
              his pains for the kernel. Balsac ingeniously compares
              his eloquence to ebony, which is bright and pleasing in
              its black light. The great master of eloquence,
              St.&nbsp;Cyprian, found such hidden stores under his
              dark language, that he is reported never to have passed
              a day without reading him; and when he called for his
              book, he used to say, “Give me my master.”</p>
            <p>
              We find this once great man, who expressed in his
              Apologetic (cap.&nbsp;39) the most just and fearful
              apprehension of excommunication, which he there called,
              The anticipation of the future judgment, afterward
              proud, arrogant, and at open defiance with the censures
              of the Church. And this great genius seems even to lose
              common sense when he writes in favor of his errors and
              enthusiasm, as when, upon the authority of the dreams of
              Priscilla and Maximilla, he seriously disputes on the
              shape and color of a human soul, &amp;c. He lived to a
              very advanced age, and leaving the Montanists, became
              the author of a new sect called from him Tertullianists,
              who had a church at Carthage till St.&nbsp;Austin’s
              time, when they were all reconciled to the Catholic
              faith. Tertullian died towards the year&nbsp;245.</p>
            <p>
              The works which he wrote after his fall are, a book On
              the Soul, pretending it to have a human figure, &amp;c.
              Another On the Flesh of Christ, proving that he took
              upon him human flesh in reality, not in appearance only.
              One on the Resurrection of the Flesh, proving that great
              mystery. Five books Against Marcion, who maintained that
              there were two principles or gods, the one good the
              other evil; that the latter was worshipped by the Jews,
              and was author of their law; but that the good god sent
              Christ to destroy his works. Against this heresiarch,
              Tertullian proves the unity of God, and the sanctity of
              the Old Law and Testament. In his book Against Praxeas
              he proves excellently the Trinity of Persons, and uses
              the very word Trinity (c.&nbsp;2), but he impiously
              condemns Praxeas, because coming from the East to Rome
              he had informed pope Victor of the errors and hypocrisy
              of Montanus; on which account he says, he had banished
              the Paraclete (Montanus) and crucified the Father.
              “Paracletum fugavit, Patrem crucifixit,” (c.&nbsp;1.)
              For Praxeas, puffed up with the title of confessor,
              broached the heresy of the Patripassians, confounding
              the three Persons, and pretending that the Father in the
              Son became man, and was crucified for us. His apology
              for the Philosophers’ Cloak, which he continued to wear
              rather than the Toga, for its conveniency, and as an
              emblem of a severer life, seems only writ to display his
              wit. His apology to Scapula, proconsul of Africa in 211,
              is an exhortation to put a stop to the persecution,
              alleging that “a Christian is no man’s enemy, much less
              the emperor’s.” In his book On Monogamy he maintains
              against the Psychici (so he calls the Catholics) that
              second marriages are unlawful, which was one point of
              his heresy. One of his arguments is, the duty of a widow
              always to pray for the soul of her deceased husband.
              (c.&nbsp;10.)</p>
            <p>
              He writ his book on Fasts, to defend the extraordinary
              fasts commanded by the Montanists; but shows that
              certain obligatory fasts were observed by the Catholics,
              as that before Easter, since called Lent, in which they
              fasted every day till vespers or evening-service: that
              those of Wednesday and Friday till three o’clock, called
              stations, were devotional. Some added to these
              Xerophagia or the use only of dried meats, abstaining
              from all vinous and juicy fruits; and some confined
              themselves to bread and water. The Montanists kept three
              Lents a year, and other fasts always till night, and
              with the Xerophagia.</p>
            <p>
              Tertullian wrote also his book On Chastity, against the
              Catholics, because they gave absolution to penitents who
              had been guilty of adultery or fornication. For the
              Montanists denied that the Church could pardon sins of
              impurity, murder, or idolatry. In this book he mentions
              twice, that on the sacred chalices was painted the image
              of the good shepherd bringing home the lost sheep on his
              shoulders. Scoffing at a decree made by the bishop of
              Rome at that time, he writes, “I&nbsp;am informed that
              they have made a decree, and even a peremptory one; the
              chief priest, that is, the bishop of bishops, saith;
              I&nbsp;remit the sins of adultery and fornication to
              those who have done penance.” (c.&nbsp;1.) He calls him
              apostolic bishop, c.&nbsp;19, and blessed pope,
              c.&nbsp;13, ib. His book On the Crown was written in
              235, the first year of Maximinus, to defend the action
              of a Christian soldier who refused to put on his head a
              garland, like the rest, when he went to receive a
              donative. Tertullian says these garlands were reputed
              sacred to some false god or other. He alleges that by
              tradition alone we practise many things, as the
              ceremonies used at baptism, yearly oblations (or
              sacrifices) for the dead, and for the festivals of
              martyrs, standing at prayer on the Lord’s day, and from
              Easter to Whitsuntide, and the sign of the cross “which
              we make,” says he, “upon our foreheads at every action,
              and in all our motions at coming in or going out of
              doors, in dressing or bathing ourselves; when we are at
              table or in bed; when we sit down or light a lamp, or
              whatever else we do.” (De Corona, c.&nbsp;3 and&nbsp;4.)
              His book On Flight, was written about the same time to
              pretend to prove against the Catholics that it is a
              crime to fly in time of persecution.</p>
            <p>
              The most correct edition of Tertullian’s works is that
              of Rigaltius, even that of Pamelius being ill pointed,
              and abounding with faults; though Rigaltius’s notes on
              this and some other fathers want much
              amendment.</p></td></tr>

              Marianus Scotus, at Mentz, wrote two hundred years
              after, in 1083, a chronicle in which mention is first
              made of this fiction; from whence it was inserted in the
              chronicle of Martinus Polonus, a Dominican, in 1277,
              though it is wanting in the true MS. copy kept in the
              Vatican library, as Leo Allatius assures us, and in
              other old MS. copies, as Burnet (Nouvelles de la Rep.
              des Lettres, Mars, 1687), Casleu (Catal. Bibl. reg.
              Londin, p.&nbsp;102), &amp;c., testify. Lambecius, the

              in his excellent catalogue of that library,
              vol.&nbsp;ii. p.&nbsp;860, has demonstrated this of the
              oldest and best manuscript copies of this chronicle;
              also of Marianus Scotus. Her name was foisted into
              Sigebert’s Chronicle, written in 1112; for it is not
              found in the original MS. copy at Gemblours,

              Scotus, probably falsified; certainly of no authority
              and inconsistent; for there it is said that she sat two
              years five months, and that she had studied at Athens,
              where no schools remained long before this
              time.</p>

              As to the porphyry stool shown in a repository belonging
              to the Lateran church, which is said to have been made
              use of on account of this fable, it is an idle dream.
              There were two such stools; one is now shown to
              travellers. It is certainly of old Roman antiquity,
              finely polished, and might perhaps be used at the baths
              or at some superstitious ceremonies. The art of cutting
              or working in porphyry marble was certainly lost long
              before the ninth age, and not restored before the time

              The emperor Adrian, nobly born at Italica, near Seville,
              in Spain, was cousin-german to Trajan; and having been
              adopted by him, upon his death ascended the imperial
              throne in&nbsp;117. He was extremely inquisitive, and
              fond of whatever was surprising or singular, well
              skilled in all curious arts, mathematics, judiciary
              astrology, physic, and music. But this, says Lord Bacon,
              was an error in his mind, that he desired to comprehend
              all things, yet neglected the most useful branches of
              knowledge. He was light and fickle; and so monstrous was
              his vanity, that he caused all to be slain who pretended
              in any art or science to rival him; and it was accounted
              great prudence in a certain person that he would not
              dispute his best with him, alleging afterward that it
              was reasonable to yield to him who commanded thirty
              legions. The beginning of this prince’s reign was
              bloody; yet he is commended in it for two things: the
              first is mentioned by Spartian, that when he came to the
              empire he laid aside all former enmities, and forgot
              past injuries: insomuch that, being made emperor, he
              said to one who had been his capital enemy: “Thou hast
              now escaped.” The other is, that, when a woman cried to
              him as he was passing by: “Hear me, Cæsar;” and he
              answered, “I&nbsp;have not leisure.” The woman replied:
              “Then cease to reign.” “Noli ergo imperare.” Whereupon
              he stopped and heard her complaint.</p></td></tr>

              Adrian became more cruel than ever towards the end of
              his life, and without any just cause put to death
              several persons of distinction. At last he fell sick of
              a dropsy at his house at Tibur. Finding that no
              medicines gave him any relief, he grew most impatient
              and fretful under his lingering illness, and wished for
              death, often asking for poison or a sword, which no one
              would give him, though he offered them money and
              impunity. His physician slew himself that he might not
              be compelled to give him poison. A&nbsp;slave named
              Mastor, a barbarian noted for his strength and boldness,
              whom the emperor had employed in hunting, was, partly by
              threats, partly by promises, prevailed upon to undertake
              it; but instead of complying, was seized with fear, and
              durst not strike him, and fled. The unhappy tyrant
              lamented day and night, that death refused to obey and
              deliver him who had caused the death of so many others.
              He at length hastened his death by eating and drinking
              things contrary to his health in his distemper, and
              expired with these words in his month, “The multitude of
              physicians hath killed the emperor.” “Turba medicorum
              Cæsarem perdidit.” (See Dio et Spartian in Adr.) He died
              in 138, being sixty-two years old, and having reigned
              twenty-one years.</p></td></tr>

              bore him; to which dominions the sons by the first wife
              thought they had a prior claim. They, by an
              unjustifiable breach of their duty, twice took up arms
              against their father; first in&nbsp;830, when the
              empress Judith was banished to a nunnery in Gascony, and
              the emperor imprisoned; but he was soon released by the
              Germans, and recalled Judith and her two brothers. In
              the second rebellion, in&nbsp;833, Lothaire, the eldest
              son, banished Judith to Verona in Italy, and shut up her
              son Charles in the abbey of Pruim, near Triers, and the
              weak emperor himself in the abbey of St.&nbsp;Medard’s

              from the empire, and guilty of the crimes which were
              laid to his charge. He was afterward sent to the abbey
              of St.&nbsp;Denys near Paris, and there clothed with the
              habit of a monk; but soon after delivered by his two
              younger sons, Pepin and Louis, and restored to his
              throne. Judith after all these disturbances so
              dexterously managed him that, at his death in&nbsp;840,
              he left to her son Charles the monarchy of

              This book of Jansenius was condemned by Urban&nbsp;VIII.
              in&nbsp;1641, and in&nbsp;1653 Innocent&nbsp;X. censured
              five propositions to which the errors contained in this
              book were principally reduced. Alexander&nbsp;VII.
              in&nbsp;1656 confirmed these decrees, and in 1665
              approved the formulary proposed by the French clergy for
              the manner of receiving and subscribing them. Paschasius
              Quenel, a French oratorian, published in&nbsp;1671 his
              book of Moral Reflections on the Gospels, which he
              afterward augmented, and added like reflections on the
              rest of the New Testament, which work he printed
              complete in&nbsp;1693 and&nbsp;1694. In it he craftily
              insinuated the errors of Jansenius, and a contempt of
              the censures of the Church. Clement&nbsp;XI. condemned
              this book, in&nbsp;1708; and in&nbsp;1713 by the
              Constitution Unigenitus, censured one hundred and one
              propositions extracted out of it. These decrees were all
              received and promulgated by the clergy of France, and
              registered in the parliament of that kingdom that they
              might receive the force of a law of the state; and they
              are adopted by the whole Catholic Church, as cardinal
              Bissy, Languet, and other French prelates have clearly
              demonstrated.</p>
            <p>
              The Jansenian heresy is downright Predestinationism,
              than which no doctrine can be imagined more monstrous
              and absurd. The principal errors couched in the doctrine
              of Jansenists are, that God sometimes refuses, even to
              the just, sufficient grace to comply with his precepts;
              that the grace which God affords man since the fall of
              Adam, is such that if concupiscence be stronger, it
              cannot produce its effect; but if the grace be more
              powerful than the opposite concupiscence in the soul, or
              relatively to it victorious by a <i>necessitating</i>
              influence, that then it cannot be resisted, rejected, or
              hindered; and that Christ by his death paid indeed a
              price sufficient for the redemption of all men, and
              offered it to purchase some weak insufficient graces for
              reprobate souls, but not to procure them means truly
              applicable, and sufficient for their salvation; which is
              really to confine the death of Christ to the elect, and
              to deprive the reprobate of sufficient means to attain
              to salvation. The main-spring or hinge of this system is
              that the grace which inclines man’s will to supernatural
              virtue, since the fall of Adam, consists in a moral
              pleasurable motion or a delectation infused into the
              soul inclining her to virtue, as concupiscence carries
              her to vice; and that the power of delectation, whether
              of virtue or vice, which is stronger, draws the will by
              an inevitable necessity as it were by its own
              weight.</p>
            <p>
              The equivocations by which some advocates for these
              erroneous principles have endeavored to disguise or
              soften their harshness, only discover their fear of the
              light. A&nbsp;certain modern philosopher is more daring
              who, in spite not only of revelation, which he
              disclaims, but also of reason and experience, openly
              denies all free-will or election in human actions,
              pretending to apply this system of a two-fold
              delectation to every natural operation of the will. (See
              Hume’s Essay on Free-Will.) Those who obstinately oppose
              the decrees of the Church in these disputes, without
              adopting any heretical principle condemned as such by
              the Church, but found their unjust exceptions in some
              points of discipline, or any other weak pretences,
              cannot be charged with heresy: nevertheless, only
              invincible ignorance can exempt them from the guilt of
              disobedience though they should not proceed to a
              schismatical separation in communion.</p></td></tr>

              John Cassian, priest and abbot of the great monastery
              of St.&nbsp;Victor’s at Marseilles, was a native of
              Lesser Scythia, then comprised under Thrace. He inured
              himself from his youth to the exercises of an ascetic
              life in the monastery of Bethlehem. The great
              reputation of many holy anchorets in the deserts of
              Egypt induced him and one Germanus, about the
              year&nbsp;390, to pay them a visit. Being much edified
              with the great examples of virtue they saw in those
              solitudes, especially in the wilderness of Sceté, they
              spent there and in Thebais several years. They lived
              like the monks of that country, went bare-foot, and so
              meanly clad that their friends would have been ashamed
              to meet them, and they gained their subsistence by
              their work, as all the rest did. (Col.&nbsp;4,
              c.&nbsp;10.) Their life was most austere, and they
              scarce ate two loaves a day each of six ounces.
              (Col.&nbsp;19, c.&nbsp;17.) In&nbsp;403 they both went
              to Constantinople, where they listened to the spiritual
              instructions of St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, who ordained
              Cassian deacon, and employed him in his church. After
              the banishment of that holy prelate, Cassian and
              Germanus travelled to Rome with letters from the clergy
              of Constantinople to defend their injured pastor as
              Palladius informs us. Cassian was promoted to the order
              of priesthood in the West, and retiring to Marseilles,
              there founded two monasteries, one for men, and another
              for virgins, and wrote his spiritual Conferences and
              other works. He died in odor of sanctity soon after the
              year&nbsp;433. His very ancient picture is shown in
              St.&nbsp;Victor’s at Marseilles, where his head and
              right arm are exposed in shrines on the altar, by the
              permission of pope Urban&nbsp;V., the remainder of his
              body lies in a marble tomb which is shown in a
              subterraneous chapel. That abbey, by a special grant,
              celebrates an office in his honor on the 23d of
              July.</p>
            <p>
              His works consist, first of a book On the Incarnation,
              against Nestorius, written at the request of
              St.&nbsp;Leo, then archdeacon of Rome. Secondly, Of
              Institutions of a Monastical Life, in twelve books. In
              the four first he describes the habit that was worn,
              and the exercises and way of living that were followed
              by the monks of Egypt, to serve as a pattern for the
              monastic state in the West. He says, their habit was
              mean, merely serving to cover their nakedness; having
              short sleeves which reached no further than their
              elbows; they wore a girdle and a cowl upon their heads,
              but used no shoes, only a kind of sandals which they
              put off when they approached the altar; and they all
              used a walking-staff, as an emblem that they were
              pilgrims on earth. He observes that the monks forsook
              all things, labored with their hands, and lived in
              obedience; he describes the canonical hours of the
              divine office consisting of psalms and lessons. He
              mentions that whoever desires to be admitted into a
              monastery, must give proofs of his patience, humility,
              and contempt of the world, and be tried with denials
              and affronts; that no postulant was allowed to give his
              estate to the monastery in which he settled; that the
              first lesson which is taught a monk is, to subdue his
              passions, to deny his own will, and to practise blind
              obedience to his superior. Thus he is to empty himself
              of all prevalence in his own abilities, learning, or
              whatever can feed any secret pride or presumption.
              Cassian observes, that young monks were allowed no
              other food than boiled herbs, with a little salt; but
              that the extraordinary austerities of the Oriental
              monks in eating are not practicable in the
              west. In the eight last books of this work he
              treats of eight capital vices, prescribing the remedies
              and motives against them, and explaining the contrary
              virtues. He shows (l.&nbsp;6, Inst. c.&nbsp;5,&nbsp;6),
              that chastity is a virtue which is not to be obtained
              but by a special grace of God; which must be implored
              by earnest prayer, seconded by watchfulness and
              fasting. He everywhere advises moderate fasts, but
              continual, (l.&nbsp;5, p.&nbsp;107, &amp;c.). He
              observes (l.&nbsp;11, c.&nbsp;4), that vain-glory is
              the last vice that is subdued, and that it takes
              occasion even from the victory itself to renew its
              assaults. This seems the best and most useful of
              Cassian’s writings, though the reading of his
              Conferences has been strongly recommended to monks by
              St.&nbsp;Bennet, St.&nbsp;John Climacus,
              St.&nbsp;Gregory, St.&nbsp;Dominic, St.&nbsp;Thomas,
              and others.</p>
            <p>
              In the book of his Conferences he has collected the
              spiritual maxims of the wisest and most experienced
              monks with whom he had conversed in Egypt. This work
              consists of three parts; the first contains ten
              Conferences, and was written in 423; the second
              comprises seven Conferences, and was compiled two years
              later; the third was finished in&nbsp;428, and contains
              seven other Conferences. Cassian, in this work, teaches
              that the end to which a monk consecrates all his labors
              and for which he has renounced the world, is, the more
              easily to attain the most perfect purity or singleness
              of heart, without which no one can see God in his
              glory, or enjoy his presence by his special grace in
              this life. For this he must forsake the world, or its
              goods and riches; he must renounce or die to himself,
              divesting himself of all vices and irregular
              inclinations; and thirdly, he must withdraw his heart
              from earthly or visible things to apply it to those
              that are spiritual and divine. (Collat.&nbsp;1
              and&nbsp;3.) He says, that the veil of the passions
              being once removed, the eyes of the mind will begin, as
              it were naturally to contemplate the mysteries of God,
              which remain always unintelligible and obscure to those
              who have only eyes of flesh, or whose hearts are
              unclean, and their eyes overclouded with sin and the
              world. (Coll.&nbsp;5.) This purgation of the heart is
              made by the exercises of compunction, mortification,
              and self-denial; and the unshaken foundation of the
              most profound humility must be laid, which may bear a
              tower reaching to the heavens; for, upon it is to be
              raised the superstructure of all spiritual virtues.
              (Coll.&nbsp;9.)</p>
            <p>
              To gain a victory over vices he strenuously inculcates
              the advantages of discovering all temptations to our
              superior, for when detected, they lose their force; the
              filthy serpent being by confession drawn out of his
              dark hole into the light and in a manner exposed,
              withdraws himself. His suggestions prevail so long as
              they are concealed in the heart. (Coll.&nbsp;2,
              c.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;11, and Instit. l,&nbsp;9,
              c.&nbsp;39.) This he confirms by the example of
              Serapion, cured of an inveterate habit of stealing
              bread above his allowance in the community, by
              confessing the fault. (Coll.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;11.) But
              he teaches that these exercises are but preparations;
              for the end and perfection of the monastic state
              consists in continual and uninterrupted perseverance in
              prayer, as far as human frailty will permit. This is
              the conjunction of the heart with God. But this spirit
              of prayer cannot be obtained without mighty contrition,
              the purgation of the heart from all earthly corruption
              and the dregs of passion, and the illumination of the
              Holy Ghost, whose purest rays cannot enter an unclean
              heart. He compares the soul to a light feather which by
              its own levity is raised on high by the help of a
              gentle breath; but if wet by the accession of moisture,
              is depressed down to the very earth. The mind can only
              ascend to God when it is disburdened of the weight of
              earthly solicitude and corruption. (Coll.&nbsp;9.)</p>
            <p>
              He inculcates the use of frequent aspirations,
              recommending that of the Church, “Deus, in adjutorium
              meum intende,” &amp;c.; and says, the end of the
              perfection of the monastic state is, that the mind be
              refined from all carnal dust, and elevated to spiritual
              things, till by daily progress in this habit all its
              conversation may be virtually one continual prayer, and
              all the soul’s love, desire, and study, may be
              terminated in God. In this her union with him by
              perpetual and inseparable charity, she possesses an
              image of future bliss, and a foretaste or earnest of
              the conversation of the blessed. Inveighing against
              lukewarmness in devotion he makes this remark
              (Coll.&nbsp;4, c.&nbsp;19): “We have often seen souls
              converted to perfection from a state of coldness, that
              is, from among worldlings and heathens; but have never
              seen any from among tepid Christians. These are
              moreover so hateful to God, that by the prophet he bids
              his teachers not to direct any exhortations to them,
              but to abandon them as a fruitless barren land, and to
              sow the divine word on new hearts, among sinners and
              heathens: ‘Break up the new or fallow ground, and sow
              not upon land that is overrun with thorns.’” (Jer.
              iv.&nbsp;3.) He exceedingly extols the unspeakable
              peace and happiness which souls enjoy in seeking only
              God, and the great and wonderful works which he
              performs in the hearts of his saints, which cannot be
              truly known to any man except to those who have
              experience of them. (Coll.&nbsp;12, c.&nbsp;12, and
              Coll.&nbsp;14, c.&nbsp;14.) Cassian, in the thirteenth
              Conference, under the name of the abbot Cheremon,
              favors the principles of the Semipelagians, though that
              error was not then condemned, it being first proscribed
              in the second council of Orange in&nbsp;529. Whence
              St.&nbsp;Prosper himself, in his book against this
              discourse, never names him, but styles him a catholic
              doctor. (l.&nbsp;contra Collatorem, p.&nbsp;828.)
              Cassian’s style, though neither pure nor elegant, is
              plain, affecting, and persuasive. His works were
              published with comments by Alard Gazæus or Gazet, a
              Benedictin monk of St.&nbsp;Vaast’s at Arras, first at
              Douay in&nbsp;1616; and afterward with more ample notes
              at Arras in&nbsp;1618. They have been since reprinted
              at Lyons, Paris, and Francfort. See Dom. Rivet, Hist.

              Among the great men which this abbey produced in its
              infancy, the most famous are Hugh and Richard of
              St.&nbsp;Victor. Hugh, a native of the territory of
              Ypres in Flanders, became a canon regular in this
              monastery in&nbsp;1115, was made prior, and taught
              divinity there from the year&nbsp;1130 to his death
              in&nbsp;1142. His works are printed in three vols.
              folio. In the first we have his literal and historical
              notes on the scripture; also mystical and allegorical
              notes on the same by some later author of this house.
              In the second tome are contained his spiritual works;
              the soliloquy of the soul, the praise of charity, a
              discourse on the method of praying, a discourse on love
              between the Beloved and the Spouse, four books on the
              vanity of the world, one hundred sermons, &amp;c. The
              third tome presents us his theological treatises, of
              which the principal are his two books on the
              sacraments. He was called a second Augustin, or the
              tongue of that great doctor, whose spirit, sentiments,
              and style he closely follows. His notes on the rule of
              St.&nbsp;Austin, in the second tome, are excellent:
              also those on the Decalogue. The book De claustro animæ
              is very useful for religious persons, and shows the
              austere abstinence and discipline then observed in
              monasteries; but is the work of Hugh Foliet, a most
              pious and learned canon of this order, who was chosen
              abbot of St.&nbsp;Dionysius’s at Rheims, though he
              earnestly declined that dignity, in&nbsp;1149. See
              Mabillon, Analecta, t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;133, and Annal.

              Richard of St.&nbsp;Victor, a Scotsman, regular canon
              of St.&nbsp;Victor’s at Paris, scholar of Hugh, chosen
              prior of that abbey in&nbsp;1164, died in&nbsp;1173.
              His works have been often reprinted in two vols. folio;
              the best edition is that given at Rouen in&nbsp;1650.
              His comments on the scripture are too diffusive: his
              theological tracts are accurate, his writings on
              contemplation and Christian virtues, though the style
              is plain, are full of the most sublime rules of an
              interior life. The collection of spiritual maxims of
              these holy men which F.&nbsp;Gourdan has compiled from
              their writings and sayings, demonstrates their heavenly
              wisdom, lights and experience in spiritual things, and
              in the perfect spirit of all virtues to which they
              attained by an admirable purity of heart, and spirit of
              penance, prayer, and divine love.</p></td></tr>

              Mention is made in the gospels of a woman who was a
              sinner (Luke&nbsp;vii.), of Mary of Bethania, the sister
              of Lazarus (John xi.&nbsp;2, xii.&nbsp;1, Mark
              xiv.&nbsp;3, Mat. xxvi.&nbsp;6.), and of Mary Magdalen,
              who followed Jesus from Galilee, and ministered to him.
              Many grave authors think all this belongs to one and the
              same person; that she fell into certain disorders in her
              youth, and in chastisement was delivered over to be
              possessed by seven devils; that she addressed herself to
              Jesus in the house of Simon the pharisee, and by her
              compunction deserved to hear from him that her sins were
              forgiven her; and in consequence was delivered from the
              seven devils: that with her brother Lazarus, and her
              sister Martha, she left Galilee and settled at Bethania,
              where Jesus frequently honored their house with his
              presence. (See Pezron, Hist. Evang. t.&nbsp;2,
              p.&nbsp;350.) St.&nbsp;Clement of Alexandria,
              (l.&nbsp;2, Pædag. c.&nbsp;8.) Ammonius,
              (Harmon.&nbsp;4, Evang.) St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great,
              (hom.&nbsp;25 and&nbsp;33, in Evang.) and from his time
              the greater part of the Latins down to the sixteenth
              century adopt this opinion; though St.&nbsp;Ambrose,
              (lib. de Virgin. et l.&nbsp;6, in Luc.) St.&nbsp;Jerom,
              (in Mat. xxvi. l.&nbsp;2, contr. Jovin. c.&nbsp;16,
              Præf. in Osee et ep.&nbsp;150.) St.&nbsp;Austin,
              (tr.&nbsp;49, in Joan. n.&nbsp;3.) Albertus Magnus, and
              St.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas leave the question undetermined.
              The two last say the Latins in their time generally
              presumed that they were the same person, but that the
              Greeks distinguished them. Baronius, Jansenius of Ghent,
              Maldonat, Natalis Alexander, (in Hist. Eccl.
              Sæc.&nbsp;1, Diss.&nbsp;17.) Lami, (Harmon. Evang. et
              epist. Gallicâ.) Mauduit, (Analyse des Evang.
              t.&nbsp;2.) Pezron, Trevet, and strenuously Solier the
              Bollandist, t.&nbsp;5, Julij, p.&nbsp;187, and others
              have written in defence of the opinion of
              St.&nbsp;Gregory the Great.</p>
            <p>
              Others think these were distinct persons. This sentiment
              is adopted by the Apostolic Constitutions, (l.&nbsp;3,
              c.&nbsp;6.) St.&nbsp;Theophilus of Antioch, (in
              4&nbsp;Evang.) St.&nbsp;Irenæus, (l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;4.)
              Origen, (hom.&nbsp;35, in Mat. et hom.&nbsp;1,
              or&nbsp;2, Cant.) St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, (hom.&nbsp;81, in
              Mat.&nbsp;26, et hom.&nbsp;61, in Joan.)
              St.&nbsp;Macanus, (hom.&nbsp;12,) and by almost all the
              Greeks. Among the modern critics Casaubon,
              (Exercit.&nbsp;14, in Baron.) Estius, (Or.&nbsp;14,)
              three Jesuits, viz., Bulanger, (Diatrab.&nbsp;3,
              p.&nbsp;15,) Turrian, (in Consens. l.&nbsp;3,
              c.&nbsp;6,) and Salmeron, (t.&nbsp;9, tr.&nbsp;49,) also
              Zagers, a learned Franciscan, (in Joan.&nbsp;11.)
              Mauconduit, Anquetin, Tillemont, (t.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;30,
              et&nbsp;512.) Hammond, and many others, strenuously
              assert these to have been three distinct women.</p>
            <p>
              Some, whose sentiment appears most plausible to Toinard
              and Calmet, distinguish the sister of Lazarus and
              Magdalen; for this latter attended Christ the last year
              of his life, and seems to have followed him from Galilee
              to Jerusalem, when he came up to the Passover, (see Mat.
              xxvii.&nbsp;56,&nbsp;57, Mark xv.&nbsp;40,&nbsp;41, Luke
              xxiii.&nbsp;49,) at which time the sister of Lazarus was
              with her brother and Martha at Bethania, (John
              xi.&nbsp;1.) Moreover, these two women seem distinctly
              characterized, the one being called Magdalen, and being
              ranked among the women that followed Jesus from Galilee,
              the other being everywhere called the sister of Lazarus;
              and though she might have possessed an estate at
              Magdalum in Galilee, and have come originally from that
              country, this constant distinction of epithets naturally
              leads us to imagine them different persons; but
              St.&nbsp;Irenæus, Origen, St.&nbsp;Chrysostom, &amp;c.,
              nowhere distinguish the penitent and Magdalen: and
              St.&nbsp;Luke having mentioned the conversion of the
              sinful woman (at Naim) in the next chapter, subjoins,
              that certain women who had been delivered by him from
              evil spirits and infirmities, followed him; and among
              these he names Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast
              seven devils; whence it may seem reasonable to conclude
              that the penitent and Magdalen are the same person.</p>
            <p>
              This disputation, however, seems one of those debateable
              questions which are without end, nothing appearing
              demonstrative from the sacred text, or from the
              authority of the ancients. In the Roman Breviary the
              Penitent is honored on this day under the name of Mary
              Magdalen, and for our edification the history of all
              these examples of virtue is placed in one point of view,
              as if they belonged to one person, conformably to the
              sentiment of St.&nbsp;Gregory and others; but the
              offices are distinct in the Breviaries of Paris,
              Orleans, Vienne, Cluni, and some others.</p></td></tr>

              The ancient Jews did not sit down on carpets spread on
              the floor to eat, as the Arabs, Turks, and other
              inhabitants of the countries about Palestine do at this
              day. Their tables were raised above the ground. Exod.
              xxv.&nbsp;24, Jud. l.&nbsp;7, Mat. xv.&nbsp;27, Luke
              xvi.&nbsp;21. Neither Hebrews, Greeks, nor Romans used
              napkins or table-cloths. Their ancient custom was to sit
              at table, as we do now. Prov. xxiii.&nbsp;1. But after
              Solomon’s time the Jews leaned or lay down on couches
              round the table. Amos, (iv.&nbsp;7.) Toby, (xi.&nbsp;3.)
              and Ezekiel (xxiii.&nbsp;41.) speak of eating on beds or
              couches; but this custom was not general. It was become
              very frequent in our Saviour’s time, who ate in this
              manner not only on the present occasion, but also when
              Magdalen anointed his feet, Mat. xxvi.&nbsp;7, and at
              his last supper, John xiii.&nbsp;23, so that it seems to
              have then been the ordinary custom of that country. The
              Jews seem to have learned it from the Persians, Esth.
              i.&nbsp;6, vii.&nbsp;8. They took two meals a day from
              the times of the primitive patriarchs; but never ate
              before noon, Eccles. x.&nbsp;16, Isa. v.&nbsp;11, Acts
              ii.&nbsp;15. And their dinner was usually rather a small
              refreshment than a meal; on fast-days the Jews never ate
              or drank till evening. See Calmet, Dissert. sur le

              passion, supped in the house of Simon surnamed the
              Leper, whilst Martha waited on him, and Lazarus sat at
              table, Mary anointed his feet and head with precious
              ointment which she had brought in an alabaster box. The
              Greeks and Romans practised the same custom of using
              sweet scented ointments at banquets. Judas Iscariot
              murmured at this action out of covetousness, pretending
              the price of the ointment had better been given to the
              poor; but Jesus commended Mary’s devotion, said that her
              action would be a subject of admiration and edification
              wherever his gospel should be preached, and declared
              that she had by it advanced the ceremony of embalming
              his body for his burial. Though Christ has substituted
              the poor in his stead, to be succored by us in them; yet
              he is well pleased when charity consecrates some part of
              our riches to his external worship, to whom we owe all
              that we possess. But nothing can be more odious than for
              ministers of the altar, with Judas, to cover avarice
              under a cloak of zeal. See John xii.&nbsp;1, 2,&nbsp;3,
              Mat. xxvi.&nbsp;6, Mark xiv.&nbsp;3.</p></td></tr>

              Certain Greeks, writers who lived in the seventh or
              later ages, tell us, that after the ascension of our
              Lord, St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen accompanied the Blessed
              Virgin and St.&nbsp;John to Ephesus, and died and was
              buried in that city.<a id="c22_1n"> </a>This is affirmed
              by Modestus, patriarch of Jerusalem in&nbsp;920,<a
                href="#fn_258"
                class="anchor">258</a>
              and by St.&nbsp;Gregory of Tours. St.&nbsp;Willibald, in
              the account of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, says, that
              her tomb was shown him at Ephesus. Simeon Logotheta
              mentions that the emperor Leo the Wise caused her relics
              to be translated from Ephesus to Constantinople, and
              laid in the church of St.&nbsp;Lazarus, about the year
              890. But these modern Greeks might perhaps confound Mary
              the sister of the Blessed Virgin, or the sister of
              Lazarus, or some other Mary among those that are
              mentioned in the gospel with Mary Magdalen. The relics
              shown in the monastery at Vezelay in Burgundy, ten
              leagues from Auxerre in the diocess of Autun, may be a
              portion of the body of St.&nbsp;Mary Magdalen, or of
              some other Mary mentioned in the gospel. This famous
              ancient monastery of Vezelay was secularized
              in&nbsp;1537; and the church, which is longer than that
              of our Lady at Paris, is now served only by ten
              canons.</p></td></tr>

              Some derive the pedigree and names of the Muscovites
              from Mosoch, the son of Japhet, who, with his brothers
              Magog, Thubal, and Gomer, and their children peopled the
              northern kingdoms. (Ezech. xxxviii.&nbsp;6, &amp;c.)
              These are reputed the patriarchs of the Cappadocians,
              Tartars, Scythians, Sarmatians, &amp;c. See Bochart,
              Phaleg. l.&nbsp;3, c.&nbsp;12, and Calmot. It seems not
              to be doubted, that the Moschi, mentioned by Strabo and
              Mela, and situated between Colchis and Armenia, near the
              Moschici Montes, were the descendants of Mosoch. As the
              Scythians from the coasts of the Euxine and Caspian seas
              afterward penetrated more northwards in Asia and Europe,
              and as the Cimmerii, who were the sons of Gomer,
              afterward settled about the Bosphorus and Mœotis, so
              some authors pretend that the Moschi passed into Europe,
              and settled near them on the borders of the Scythians
              and Sarmatians. But the Muscovites evidently take their
              name from the city of Moscow, built about the year 1149,
              so called from a monastery named Moskoi (from Mus or
              Musik, men, <i>q.&nbsp;d.</i> the Seat of Men), not from
              the river Moscow, which was anciently called
              Smorodina.<a id="fn_270a"> </a>(See J.&nbsp;S. Bayei,
              Orig. Russiæ, t.&nbsp;8, Acad. Petrop. p.&nbsp;390.) For
              the name of Muscovites was not given to this tribe of
              Russians before the beginning of the fourteenth century.
              It was assumed on the following occasion: In&nbsp;1319,
              Gedimidius, great duke of Lithuania, having vanquished
              the Russian duke of Kiow, the archbishop Peter removed
              his see to Moscow, and from that town these Russians
              began then to be called Muscovites; for the duke John,
              son of Daniel, soon followed the archbishop, and
              transferred thither the seat of his principality from
              Uladimiria: though the archbishop of Kiow continued to
              take the title of Metropolitan of all Russia. See
              Herbersteinus (Chorographia Principatus Ducis Moscoviæ;
              also, in Rerum Muscovitarum Commentar.) and more
              accurately Ignatius Kulczynski, in Latin Kulcinius, a
              Basilian monk at Rome. (Specimen Ecclesiæ Ruthenicæ,
              printed at Rome in&nbsp;1733, also Catalog. archiepisc.
              Kioviensium; and Series Chronol. Magn. Russiæ seu
              Moscoviæ Ducum.) Hence the name of Muscovites first
              occurs in Chalcocondylus and other Greek historians
              about that time. We are informed by these authors, and
              by Herbersteinius, that these Russians were tributary to
              the Tartar king of Agora in Asia from&nbsp;1125
              to&nbsp;1506. But since they shook off that yoke they
              have subdued the Russians of Novogorod and other places
              in Europe, and have extended their dominions almost to
              the extremity of Asia in Great Tartary. See Bayer, Diss.
              de Russorum primâ expedit. Constantinopolitana,
              t.&nbsp;6, Comm. Acad. Petrop. et Orig. Russiæ, ib.
              t.&nbsp;8. Also Jos. Assemani, De Kalend. Univ.
              t.&nbsp;1, par.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;275.</p>
            <p>
              The name, Russi or Rossi, seems not to be older than the
              ninth century. Cedrenus and Zonarus speak of them as a
              Scythian nation inhabiting the northern side of Mount
              Taurus, a southern region of Asiatic Scythia, now Great
              Tartary. They are a nation entirely distinct from the
              Roxolani, the ancient Sarmatians near the Tanais, though
              these Russians afterward became masters of that country,
              and took their name either from that of Roxolani
              abridged, or from Rosseia, which in their language
              signifies an assemblage of people. Constantine
              Porphyrogenetta tells us, that the language of the
              Russians and Sclavonians was quite different; and the
              monk Nestor, in the close of the eleventh century, the
              most ancient historian of Russia, in his chronicle
              assures us, that the Russians and Sclavonians are two
              different nations; but the great affinity of the present
              Russian language with the Sclavonian shows that the
              Russians, mixing with the Sclavonians, learned in a
              great measure their language.</p>
            <p>
              It is well known that, anciently, the southern parts of
              Muscovy were inhabited by Goths, whom the Huns or
              ancient Tartars from Asia, expelled in the fourth
              century. Also that the northern part was peopled by
              Scythians, whom the Muscovites still call by the same
              name Tscudi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Scythians, and the lake
              Peipus, Tschudzhoi. We learn from Constantine
              Porphyrogenetta (l.&nbsp;De administ. Imper. c.&nbsp;9,)
              that the name of Russia was given in the tenth century
              to the country of which Kiow was the capital, and which
              comprised also Czernigov, Novogorod, &amp;c. Snorro
              Sturleson (Hist. regn. Septentr. t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;6)
              says these people called their ancient capital, situated
              towards the gulf of Finland, Aldeiguborg or Old-Town, in
              opposition to which Novogorod or New-Town, took its
              name. The Waregians, invited by the Russians to defend
              them against the Khosares, who lived near the Black or
              the Euxine Sea, crossing the Baltic, settled among the
              Russians, it is uncertain in what age. See T.&nbsp;S.

              We know not in what age the Sclavonians obtained
              settlements in the northern parts of Russia. They are
              first named in Procopius and Jornandes, were part of the
              Venedi, and with them from Sarmatia travelled into
              Germany; where they settled for some time on the coast
              of the Baltic, afterward in the centre of Germany near
              Thuringia, and in Beheim or Bohemia, where they long
              ruled and left their language. In the reign of Justinian
              they crossed the Danube, and conquered part of Pannonia
              and Illyricum, where a small territory, fifty German
              miles long, of which Peter-waradin is the most
              considerable place, between the Danube, the Drave, and
              the Save, is still called Sclavonia: it was conquered by
              the kings of Hungary, and is still subject to the house
              of Austria. The Slavi fell everywhere into so miserable
              a servitude, that from them are derived the names of
              Slavery and Slaves. The Sclavonian language is used in
              the divine office in Illyricum, &amp;c. according to the
              Latin rite; in Muscovy, &amp;c. according to the Greek
              rite. (See on SS.&nbsp;Cyril and Methodius,
              22&nbsp;Dec.) The Muscovites have no Russian Bibles; but
              with very little study can understand the Sclavonian,
              says Brusching.</p>
            <p>
              In the year&nbsp;892, Rurik, Simeus, and Tyuwor, three
              brothers from the Warengi on the other side of the
              Baltic, came by invitation into Russia, and ruled the
              Sclavonians and Russians united into one nation. Rurik
              survived his brothers, and became sole sovereign. The
              Runic inscriptions in the northern Antiquities are not
              of an older date.</p>
            <p>
              Rurik fixed his seat near the lake Ladoga. His son Igor
              transferred his court from Novogorod to Kiow. His widow
              Olga received the faith, and was baptized at
              Constantinople. Their son Suatoslas died an idolater;
              but his son Wladimir the Great married Anne, a Grecian
              princess, received baptism, and was imitated by his
              subjects. He built the city which from him is called
              Wladimiria, which under his grandson, Andrew Bogolikski,
              became the ducal residence. Wladimir&nbsp;I. is honored
              in the Muscovite Calendar. Kiow still has its dukes.
              Jaroslas, son of Wladimir, was succeeded there by his
              son Wsevolod&nbsp;I. in&nbsp;1078, in whose reign
              Ephrem, metropolitan of Kiow, established in Russia,
              pursuant to the bull of Urban&nbsp;II. the feast of the
              translation of the relics of St.&nbsp;Nicholas to Bari,
              on the 9th of May, never known in the Greek church;
              which shows their obedience to the pope, and their
              connection with the Latin church. The Greeks also were
              then Catholics. George duke of Russia at Wladimiria
              recovered Kiow, and in&nbsp;1156 built the city of
              Moscow. Jaroslas&nbsp;II. succeeded his brother
              George&nbsp;II. in the great dukedom of Russia
              in&nbsp;1238, and resided in Wladimiria. In his reign
              in&nbsp;1244, the Russians were reunited to the see of
              Rome, part having been a little before drawn into the
              Greek schism. His son Alexander, in his father’s
              life-time prince of Novogorod, with his brother Feodor
              or Theodor, gained great victories over the Tartars, who
              had long oppressed the Russians, and succeeded to the
              great dukedom in&nbsp;1246. He is surnamed Newski or of
              Newa, from a great victory which he gained in&nbsp;1241
              on the banks of the Newa, over the Poles and the
              Teutonic knights in Livonia. Those knights, who by
              victories over the idolaters had made themselves masters
              of Livonia, had their own high master at Riga, who soon
              made himself independent of the grand-master of the same
              order in Prussia. This order, which was dismembered from
              the Knights Hospitallers, or of Jerusalem (afterward of
              Rhodes and Malta), to defend the Christians in Germany
              against the inroads of the barbarous northern infidel
              nations, long produced many incomparably great heroes,
              and models of all virtues. But enriched by great
              conquests, their successors, by pride, luxury, and
              continual intestine wars, gave occasion to several
              scandals. At length, Albert, marquis of Brandenburg,
              grand-master in Prussia, turned Lutheran, and received
              from the king of Poland the investiture of ducal
              Prussia. The knights expelled by him retired to
              Mariandhal in Franconia, and there chose a new
              grand-master. He is chosen by the twelve provincial
              commanders. William of Furstenburg, Heer-meister of
              Livonia, also declared himself a Lutheran, and
              in&nbsp;1559 resigned his dignity to his coadjutor
              Gotthard Kettler. He also being a Lutheran, ceded part
              of Livonia to the Danes, and the chief part to the
              Poles, receiving from the latter the investiture of
              Courland and Samogitia as secular dukedoms; Livonia fell
              under the power of Charles&nbsp;XI. of Sweden, but was
              added to the empire of Muscovy by Peter the Great.</p>
            <p>
              To return to the grand duke Alexander Newski, he
              received an embassy from the pope in&nbsp;1262, the
              contents of which are not recorded. He died crowned with
              glory at Gorodes near Nischui-Novogorod in&nbsp;1262, on
              the 30th of April, on which day his festival is kept in
              Muscovy, and he is honored as one of the principal
              saints of the country. The tczar Peter the Great built,
              in his honor, a magnificent convent of Basilian monks on
              the banks of the Newa in Livonia, not far from his new
              city of Petersburg, the archbishop of which city resides
              in it. The empress Catharine instituted, in&nbsp;1725,
              the second Order of Knighthood in Russia under his name.
              Their daughter the empress Elizabeth caused his bones to
              be put in a rich shrine covered with thick plates of
              silver, placed at the foot of a magnificent mausoleum in
              this monastery. The Muscovites relate wonderful things
              of his eminent virtues, and miracles wrought at his
              tomb. Pope Benedict&nbsp;XIV. proves that, upon due
              authority, all this may be admitted even of one who had
              died in a material schism, or with inculpable ignorance.
              But this prince lived and died in communion with the see
              of Rome, though he has never been placed in the
              Calendars of the Catholic Church.</p>

              Daniel, fourth son of Alexander, left by his father duke
              of Moscow, after the death of an uncle and three
              brothers became Grand Duke; and from his reign
              in&nbsp;1304, Moscow became the ducal residence, till
              Peter&nbsp;I. gave a share in that honor to his new city
              of St.&nbsp;Petersburg.</p>
            <p>
              In the reign of Basil or Vasili&nbsp;II. in&nbsp;1415,
              Photius, metropolitan of Russia, residing at Kiow,
              having espoused the Greek schism, was deposed by the
              council of Novogrodek, under the protection of Alexander
              Vithold, grandduke of Lithuania. Retiring into Great
              Russia he there exceedingly promoted the schism.
              Gregory, who succeeded him at Kiow, assisted at the
              council of Constance. Iwan or John&nbsp;IV. is the first
              who took the title of Tczar in&nbsp;1552. This word in
              the Russian language signifies king. In the Russian
              Chronicles that title is given to the Greek emperors. In
              their Bibles it is used for king, both in the Russian
              and Sclavonian language.</p>
            <p>
              In Feodor or Theodore ended, in&nbsp;1598, the race of
              Rurik. After two others who had been chief ministers and
              two false Demetriuses, in 1613, Michael, of the family
              of Romanow, allied to that of the preceding tczars was
              chosen great duke. The third of this family was Peter
              the Great, founder of the Russian empire.</p></td></tr>

              Constantine Porphyrogenetta succeeded Leo the Wise in
              the empire in&nbsp;911; in&nbsp;919 he associated in the
              throne his Drungar or admiral Romanus Lecapenus, whose
              daughter Helena he had married. Romanus reigned in the
              year&nbsp;944; from which time his covetous daughter
              Helena had a great share in governing the empire.
              Constantine was buried in his studies, and dying
              in&nbsp;959, fifty-four years old, left the empire to
              his impious son Romanus&nbsp;II., who is said to have
              poisoned him, and who died in&nbsp;963, leaving the
              empire to Nicephorus Phocas, his valiant general, who
              had often defeated the Russians and Saracens. His
              daughter Anne was married to Wladimir, duke of Russia.
              Constantine Porphyrogenetta (l.&nbsp;de Cœm. Aulæ
              Byzant. l.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;15) relates, that on
              Wednesday, the 9th of September,&nbsp;946, Olga,
              princess of Russia, was received with great pomp at
              Constantinople by Constantine (himself) and Romanus,
              emperors; and describes her different receptions at
              their court, the banquets which they prepared for her,
              the presents in money which they made to her uncle of
              thirty miliaretia (each of which contained two ceratia,
              each ceratium twelve folles, of which five hundred made
              a pound of silver), eight to her priest Gregory and to
              each of her friends, to herself five hundred miliaretia
              in a gold dish studded with diamonds and precious
              stones. At each other entertainment like presents were
              distributed. The dessert of sweetmeats was served on a

              The United Russians, who, renouncing the schism,
              embraced the communion of the Roman Church, are chiefly
              subject to Poland, and ever since Clement&nbsp;VIII.
              have a metropolitan of Kiow (since Kiow was conquered by
              the Muscovites these have established there their schism
              with a metropolitan of their communion), an archbishop
              of Plosco, and bishops of Kelma, Presmilia, Liceoria,
              and Leopold, with several convents of Basilian monks,
              who all follow the Greek rites; though several Russians
              in the Polish dominions still adhere to the Greek
              schism. See Urban Cerri’s (secretary to the Propaganda)
              Relation, p.&nbsp;56, and Mamachi, Orig. et Antiquit.

              The metropolitan of Moscow was declared patriarch of all
              the Russian schismatics by Jeremy, patriarch of
              Constantinople in&nbsp;1588, and was acknowledged in
              that character by the other Oriental patriarchs. But the
              czar Peter&nbsp;I. having learned from the experience of
              above a hundred years that the patriarchs made use of
              their great influence and authority in matters of state,
              after that dignity had been vacant nineteen years,
              caused it to be abolished, and an archbishop of Moscow
              to be chosen in&nbsp;1719. For the government of the
              church of Muscovy, and receiving appeals, he appointed a
              council of eleven bishops and other clergymen, the
              president of which the czar nominates. See John Von
              Strahlenburg (Historical and Geographical Description of
              Russia and Siberia, an.&nbsp;1738) and Le Quien. (Oriens
              Christianus, t.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;1296.) Some Catholics
              enjoy the exercise of their religion in several parts of
              Muscovy. Kulcinius observes that many saints have
              flourished in this nation since it has been engaged in
              schism. Possevinus and Papebroke take notice that the
              Greeks since their schism have been reunited to the
              Latin church fourteen times. The latter of these learned
              authors also remarks, that even when the archbishops
              were most turbulent schismatics, no one will say that
              all the people were involved in the same guilt; even
              ignorance might excuse many, as Baronius answered, with
              regard to monks who lived under a schismatical abbot (ad
              an.&nbsp;1036). As for Polish Russia, F.&nbsp;Kulesza, a
              learned Polish Jesuit, in a book entitled, Fides
              Orthodoxa, printed at Vilna, assures us, that all the
              archbishops of Kiow have been Catholics, except two,
              Photius and Jonas&nbsp;II., till in&nbsp;1686 it was
              given up to the Muscovites. By the intrigues of this
              Photius, in the middle of the fifteenth century, the
              Greek schism was propagated through all
              Muscovy.</p></td></tr>

              Agrippa the Elder was a worldly man, addicted to
              pleasures, yet attached to the Jewish religion. Of this
              he gave a remarkable proof when the emperor Caligula
              ordered a statue of Jupiter to be set up in the temple
              of Jerusalem. The Jews opposed the attempt with tears
              and remonstrances, and throwing themselves prostrate on
              the ground at the feet of the Roman governor, protested
              they were ready rather to suffer death. But the
              murderers of the Son of God were unworthy to die in so
              good a cause. Agrippa exposed himself to the danger of
              losing the tyrant’s favor, and by a strong letter, which
              he wrote to him on that occasion, obtained that the
              order should be superseded at that time. When that
              emperor was attempting to renew it his death delivered
              the Jews from the danger.</p></td></tr>

              Agrippa was the first prince that persecuted the Church.
              After having put to death St.&nbsp;James, he imprisoned
              St.&nbsp;Peter, but God delivered him out of the
              persecutor’s hands. Nor was it long before this king
              felt the effects of divine vengeance. After the feast of
              the passover he returned to Cæsarea to exhibit there
              public games in honor of Claudius Cæsar, and was
              attended thither with a numerous train of the must
              considerable persons, both of his own and of the
              neighboring nations. He appeared early on the second
              morning of the shows at the theatre, in a costly robe of
              silver tissue, artfully wrought, and so bright that the
              sunbeams which darted upon it were reflected with such
              an uncommon lustre, as to dazzle the eyes of the
              spectators who beheld him with a kind of divine respect.
              He addressed himself in an elegant speech, to the
              deputies of the Tyrians and Sidonians, who were come to
              beg his pardon for some offence for which they had been
              some time in disgrace with him. Whilst he spoke, the
              ambassadors and some court sycophants gave a great
              shout, crying out that it was the voice of a god and not
              of a man. The king, too sensible of the people’s praise,
              and elated with pride, seemed to forget himself, and to
              approve, instead of checking the impious flattery. But
              at that instant the angel of the Lord smote him with a
              dreadful disease, and he felt himself seized with a
              violent pain in his bowels. Perceiving his distemper to
              be mortal, he rejected the flattery of his sycophants,
              telling them that he whom they called immortal was
              dying. Yet still full of false ideas of human grandeur,
              though he saw death inevitable, he comforted himself
              with the remembrance of the splendor in which he had
              lived. So true it is that a man dies such as he lives.
              After lingering five days in exquisite torments, under
              which no remedy gave him any ease, being eaten up by
              worms, he expired in all the miseries that can be
              expressed or imagined. This account is given us by
              Josephus (Antiq. l.&nbsp;19, c.&nbsp;7), and by
              St.&nbsp;Luke (Acts xii.&nbsp;23). He died in the
              fifty-fourth year of his age, and the seventh of his
              reign. The most learned Mr. Stukely in his medallic
              history of Carausius, t.&nbsp;2, c.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;72,
              will have it that Agrippa was smitten four days after he
              celebrated the Roman festival, in which the people made
              vows for the emperor’s health and safety, marked in the
              ancient Roman Calendar which he has published on the 4th
              of January. It was, indeed, the festival of the emperor
              Claudius, but after the passover, which happened that
              year on the 10th of April, the equinoctial new moon
              falling on the 28th of March. Herod Agrippa left a son
              of his own name, who was then at Rome with Claudius,
              only seventeen years old. The emperor would willingly
              have given him his father’s dominions; but his freemen
              and counsellors represented to him that an extensive
              kingdom was too great a burden for so young a prince to
              bear. Whereupon Judæa was again reduced into the form of
              a Roman province, and Cuspius Fadus appointed the first
              prefect or governor.</p></td></tr>

              Tatian’s Oration against the Greeks is extant. In it he
              displays much profane erudition, showing that Moses was
              older than the Gentile philosophers, who borrowed the
              sciences from the patriarchs. He wrote this piece after
              the death of Saint Justin, but before his separation
              from the Church: for in it he proves one God the Creator
              of all things, and seems to approve the state of
              matrimony. It wants method; but the style is elegant
              enough, though exuberant, and not very elaborate. This
              piece is often published at the end of the works of
              St.&nbsp;Justin. We have an accurate separate edition,
              printed at Oxford in&nbsp;1700, with notes and
              dissertations, by the care of Mr. William Worth,
              archdeacon of Worcester. P.&nbsp;Travasa in his learned
              history of heresiarchs, demonstrates against Massuet,
              &amp;c., that Tatian’s Oration against the Gentiles is
              not orthodox; and that in it the author teaches that the
              human soul is of its own nature mortal. See Travasa
              Storia Critica delle vite degli eresiarchi, t.&nbsp;2,

              From this example, it is manifest, that the African
              bishops referred greater causes, at least those of faith
              to the holy see, and in them always allowed appeals to
              it; though at that time they carried on a contest with
              the popes Innocent, Zosimus, and Celestine, against
              appeals being made in lesser causes of personal facts,
              which it is often difficult to carry on in remote
              courts, and which, if too easy and frequent, are a bar
              to the speedy execution of justice. Yet such appeals or
              revisions of causes are sometimes necessary to hinder
              crying injustices and oppressions. Whence the regulation
              of the manner of restraining appeals in smaller
              ecclesiastical causes is a point of discipline; but the
              general council of Sardica, which was an appendix of the
              council of Nice, declared, that appeals must be allowed
              from the whole world to the bishops of Rome; and in this
              discipline the Africans soon after
              acquiesced.</p></td></tr>

              Tours, which was the metropolis of the province of
              Armorica under the Romans, enjoyed, from the time of
              St.&nbsp;Martin, the metropolitical jurisdiction over
              Mans, Angers, and the nine bishoprics of Brittany.
              Sampson the elder, bishop of York, being expelled by the
              Saxons, came into Armorica, and founded the see of Dole,
              in which he exercised a metropolitical jurisdiction,
              which king Howel or Rioval obliged him to assert,
              because these Britons were an independent people,
              separate from the Gauls. Sampson’s two successors,
              St.&nbsp;Turiave and St.&nbsp;Sampson, enjoyed the same.
              The contest between Tours and Dole was not finished till
              Innocent&nbsp;III. In 1199, declared Dole and all the
              other bishoprics of Brittany subject to the archbishop

              Constantine Cajetan, a Benedictin of the Congregation of
              Mount Cassino, pretends this book to have been first
              written by Gracias Cisneros or Swan, a Benedictin abbot
              of Montserrat. But the work of that pious and learned
              abbot is a very different piece, as is evident to every
              one that will compare the two books, and as Pinius
              demonstrates. That of Cisneros is indeed full of unction
              and spiritual knowledge; but compiled in a scholastic
              method, and runs into superfluous subdivisions. The
              meditations of St.&nbsp;Ignatius are altogether new, and
              written upon a different plan. He appoints, for the
              foundation of these exercises, a moving meditation on
              the end for which we are created, that we fully convince
              ourselves that nothing is otherwise to be valued,
              sought, or enjoyed, than as it conduces to the honor and
              service of God. The meditations on the fall of the
              angels and of man, on the future punishments of sin, and
              on the last things, show us the general effects of sin.
              To point out the particular disorders of our passions,
              and to purge our hearts of them, he represents to us the
              two standards of Christ and the devil, and all men
              ranging themselves under the one or the other, that we
              may be moved ardently to make our choice with the
              generous souls that follow Christ. Then he proposes what
              this resolution requires, and how we are to express in
              ourselves the perfect image of our Saviour, by the three
              degrees of humility, by meditating on the mysteries of
              Christ’s life, and by choosing a state of life, and
              regulating our employments in it. By meditating on
              Christ’s sufferings, he will have us learn the heroic
              virtues of meekness and charity, &amp;c., he taught us
              by them to fortify our souls against contradictions; and
              by those on his glorious mysteries, and on the happiness
              of divine love, he teaches us to unite our hearts
              closely to God. See Bartoli,

              There is another religious Order, very famous in Italy,
              established for the education of youth, called the
              Regular Clergy of the <i>Schola Pia</i>. The founder was
              F.&nbsp;Joseph Cazalana, a nobleman of Arragon. He took
              priestly orders in&nbsp;1582, and, going to Rome,
              devoted himself with great fervor to the heroic practice
              of all good works, especially to the catechising and
              teaching of children. To propagate this design, he
              instituted a congregation of priests, approved by
              Paul&nbsp;V. in&nbsp;1617, and declared a religious
              Order with ample privileges, by Gregory&nbsp;XV.
              in&nbsp;1621. These religious men bind themselves by a
              fourth vow, to labor in instructing children, especially
              the poor. The holy founder died in&nbsp;1648, on the
              25th of August.</p></td></tr>

              He appointed no other habit than that used by the clergy
              in his time, the more decently and courteously to
              converse with all ranks of people, and because he
              instituted an order only of regular clerks. He would not
              have his religious to keep choir, because he destined
              their time to evangelical functions. He ordered all,
              before they are admitted, to employ a month for a
              general confession and a spiritual exercise. After this,
              two years in a novitiate; then to take the simple vows
              of scholars, binding themselves to poverty, chastity,
              and obedience, which vows make them strictly religious
              men; for by them a person in this Order irrevocably
              consecrates himself to God on his side, though the Order
              does not bind itself absolutely to him, and the general
              has power to dismiss him; by which discharge he is freed
              from all obligation to the Society, his first vows being
              made under this condition. These simple vows are only
              made in the presence of domestics. The professed Jesuits
              make these same vows again (commonly after all their
              studies) but publicly, and without the former condition;
              so that these second are solemn vows, absolutely binding
              on both sides: wherefore a professed Jesuit can be no
              more dismissed by his Order, so as to be discharged from
              his obligations by which he is tied to it. In these last
              is added a fourth vow of undertaking any missions,
              whether among the faithful or infidels, if enjoined them
              by the pope. There is a class of Jesuits who take the
              other vows, without this last relating to the missions;
              and these are called spiritual coadjutors. So this Order
              consists of four sorts of persons; scholars or Jesuits
              of the first vows; professed Jesuits or of the last or
              four vows; spiritual coadjutors, and temporal
              coadjutors.</p>
            <p>
              No particular bodily mortifications are prescribed by
              the rule of the Society; but two most perfect practices
              of interior mortification are rigorously enjoined, on
              account of which Suarez (t.&nbsp;3, de Relig.) who
              treats at length of the obligations of their Order,
              calls it the most rigorous of religious Orders; the
              first is, the rule of Manifestation, by which every one
              is bound to discover his interior inclinations to his
              superior; the second is, that every Jesuit renounces his
              right to his own reputation with his superior, giving
              leave to every brother to inform immediately his
              superior of all his faults he knows, without observing
              the law of private correction first, which is a precept
              of fraternal charity, unless where a person has given up
              his right.</p>
            <p>
              The general nominates the provincial and rectors; but he
              has five assistants nominated by the general
              congregation, who prepare all matters to his hands, each
              for the province of his assistency; and these have
              authority to call a general congregation to depose the
              general if he should evidently transgress the rules of
              the Society. Every provincial is obliged to write to the
              general once every month, and once in three years
              transmit to him an account of all the Jesuits in his
              province. The perfect form of government which is
              established, the wisdom, the unction, the zeal, and the
              consummate knowledge of men, which appear throughout all
              these constitutions, will be a perpetual manifest
              monument of the saint’s admirable penetration, judgment,
              and piety. He wrote his constitutions in Spanish, but
              they were done into Latin by his secretary, father John
              Polancus. It is peculiar to the Society, that the
              religious, after their first vows, retain some time the
              dominion or property of their patrimony, without the
              administration (for this later condition is now
              essential to a religious vow of poverty), till they make
              their renunciation.</p>
            <p>
              St.&nbsp;Ignatius forbade the fathers of his Society to
              undertake the direction of nunneries on the following
              occasion. In&nbsp;1545, Isabel Rozella, a noble Spanish
              widow, and two others, with the approbation of pope
              Paul&nbsp;III. put themselves under St.&nbsp;Ignatius’s
              direction, to live according to his rule; but he soon
              repented and procured from his Holiness, in&nbsp;1547,
              the abovesaid prohibition, saying, that such a task took
              up all that time which he desired to dedicate to a more
              general good in serving many. When certain women in
              Flanders and Piedmont afterward assembled in houses
              under vows and this rule, and called themselves
              Jesuitesses, their institute was abolished by
              Urban&nbsp;VIII. in&nbsp;1631, the end and exercises of
              this society not suiting that sex.</p></td></tr>

              Bayle makes exceptions to the miracles of
              St.&nbsp;Ignatius because Ribadeneira, in the first life
              of this saint, which he wrote in&nbsp;1572, inquires why
              his sanctity was not equally attested by wonderful
              miracles as that of the founders of some other Orders.
              “Quamobrem illius sanctitas minus est testata
              miraculis,” &amp;c. But in this very edition, in the
              last chapter, p.&nbsp;209, he writes: “Mihi tantum abest
              ut ad vitam Ignatii illustrandam miracula deesse
              videantur, ut multa eaque præstantissima judicem in
              mediâ luce versari.” He then recapitulates some facts
              which he had before related, and which he esteems
              miraculous, as a rapture in which the saint continued
              for eight days; so many wonderful, heavenly
              illuminations and revelations; the restoration of
              F.&nbsp;Simon, who lay dangerously sick, to his health,
              pursuant to his prediction; the wonderful deliverance of
              a demoniac; the cures of several sick persons; the
              foretelling many particular things to private persons,
              &amp;c. The author republished this life in&nbsp;1587,
              with some additions. He afterwards wrote a Latin
              abstract of this first life, in which he inserted many
              miracles. This he calls “Alteram breviorem vitam, sed
              multis ac novas miraculis auctam.” In this he tells us,
              that he had before been more cautious in relating
              miracles, because they had not yet been examined and
              approved; but that he chose some which were esteemed
              miraculous, not in the opinion of the common people, but
              in the judgment of prudent persons. See this remark also
              in the Spanish abstract of this life, published
              in&nbsp;1604; and in the Latin abstract reprinted at
              Ipres in&nbsp;1612. In his Spanish life of
              St.&nbsp;Ignatius, among his lives of saints, printed
              in&nbsp;1604, he writes thus: “Though, when I&nbsp;first
              printed his life in&nbsp;1572, I&nbsp;knew of some
              miracles of the holy father, I&nbsp;did not look upon
              them to be so verified (averiguados) as to think that
              I&nbsp;ought to publish them, which afterward, by the
              authentical informations taken for his canonization,
              were proved true by credible witnesses; and the Lord,
              who is pleased to exalt him, and make him glorious on
              earth, works daily such miracles on his account as
              oblige me to relate part of them here, taken from the
              original juridical informations which several bishops
              have made, and from the depositions made upon oath by
              the persons on whom the miracles were wrought,” &amp;c.
              Ribad. Spanish lives, p.&nbsp;1124. Moreover,
              Ribadeneira mentions in his first and second edition of
              this life, prophecies, revelations, visions, and the
              like miraculous favors, and he expressly distinguishes
              these from the gift of miracles, by which he means
              miraculous cures and the like, though the former may be
              justly placed in the general class of miracles. If the
              works of Ribadeneira on this subject be all carefully
              perused, it will be easy to discern the scrupulous
              accuracy of the author in this point; and the candid
              reader will be convinced how much some have
              misrepresented his testimony. Nor was he allowed to
              publish miracles before they had been approved, as the
              Council of Trent severely ordained. (Sess.&nbsp;25, de
              Inv. Sanct.) See on it Julius Nigronius (Disp. Hist.de
              SS.&nbsp;Ignatio et Cajetano, n.&nbsp;57) and Pinius the
              Bollandist in his confutation of this slander.</p>
              <p>
              In the relation made in the secret consistory before
              Gregory&nbsp;XV. of miracles which had been examined and
              approved by the cardinal à Monte and other commissaries,
              are mentioned the supernatural light shining on his face
              at prayer, upon the testimony of St.&nbsp;Philip Neri
              and F.&nbsp;Oliver Manerius. That St.&nbsp;Ignatius, by
              his blessing and prayer, cured one Bastida of the
              falling sickness, and the hand of a cook miserably
              burnt; delivered Pontanus from most violent temptations
              with which he had been grievously molested for two
              years, &amp;c.: but the miracles which are chiefly
              attended to in a canonization, are those which have been
              performed after the person’s death. Of such, many
              manifest ones were approved, first by the Auditors of
              the Rota, and afterward by the Congregation of Rites.
              Among these are mentioned the following: Isabel
              Rabelles, a nun of Barcelona, sixty-seven years old,
              in&nbsp;1601, had broken her thigh-bone; and being
              attended by a physician and surgeon during forty days,
              and under grievous pains and a violent fever, was
              expected to die that night, and given over as to all
              natural remedies; when by applying a relic of
              St.&nbsp;Ignatius, and saying the Lord’s Prayer and Hail
              Mary, with an invocation of this saint, the swelling of
              the thigh and leg went down, she found herself able to
              stir both, and without any pain; and calling for her
              clothes she got up, walked perfectly, and with ease, and
              felt no more of her complaint, not even at new moons or
              in the dampest seasons. Anne Barozellona, at Valladolid,
              almost sixty years old, was cured of a desperate palsy
              by invoking St.&nbsp;Ignatius, with a vow to perform a
              novena. A&nbsp;widow who had lost her sight in both her
              eyes, recovered it by recommending herself to the
              prayers of Saint Ignatius, and touching her eyes with a
              relic, &amp;c. F.&nbsp;Jos. Juvency (Hist. Soc. Jesu,
              l.&nbsp;15, part&nbsp;5, §&nbsp;9) has selected and
              related many like miracles of St.&nbsp;Ignatius.
              F.&nbsp;Daniel Bartoli, in his life of this saint, has
              given a history of a hundred such miracles (l.&nbsp;5).
              See also the great collection made by F.&nbsp;Pinius,
